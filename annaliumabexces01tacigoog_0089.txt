96. Graecisms. Nearly all oi those lound in Tacitus appear to have
been already more or less naturaliaed in Latin. Most ol them have
been already noticed (secli rr, rad, 13, ι6, ru, 37 d, 54, 60 6, 63, 64,
66, ⁶7¹- To these may be added the use oi si with expressions oi iear,

struction nisi sorte . . . plures curas, irc, 6. 33, 5; 666 the phrase ut
quisque audentiae habuisset 15. 53, 3. The list oi Greek words used
by him (see Nipp. on ι4. 15, 6) is not large, and consists wholly ol'
terma more or less technical, and which have no strict Latin equivalent.

Dr. §i 67, ι47, ι9ι 658.

96. Latin archarismo. The desire ol novelty in diction appears to
have led Tacitus sometimes to revive obsolete words 666 iorrns from old
writers, in preference to employing those which were usual (Wdlillin,
Philol. xxv. ιο6, dcc). Among such may be noticed dissertare ι6. ιι, ι
(Cato and Plaut.); mercimonium ι 538, 6(Ρ16ιιῐ.); perduellis 14. 69, 6
