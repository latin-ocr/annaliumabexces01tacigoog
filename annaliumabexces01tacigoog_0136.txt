Alexandria, and in area and magnificence rivalled by neitber¹‚ would, by
its seductions, as well as those ol its famous suburb ol Daphne '‚ be iata] ·
to rnany a soldier's discipline ¹. Next to these, Egypt, with its vast
grenones, suange fanaticisms ⁴, and the motley crowd ol Alexandria, prob
ably greater, aud certainly lar more turbulent than that os Antioch³‚
trith its vast granario, and terrible power ol menacing Rome itsell with
lamine ς must have been the chief object ol solicitude to Caesar.

The amount ol provincial revenne was probably not reduced, but the
mode ol assessment reorganiaed⁸; and, in general terms, it is admitted
even by Tacitus, that the provinces were better oll under the principare
than under the Republic', and were treated with marked justice and
moderatiora during at least the early years ol Tiberius⁸; and that the
Caesarian provinces were so lar more economically governed than the
senatorial, that a change stom one to the other was a virtual abatement
ol tribute ⁹. lu both classes ol provinces, extortion was severely cbecked ¹⁰
instead ol being criminally connived at; and governors were warned to
shear, not day, their sheep ¹¹, whose prosperity had become the common
interest ol ruled and ruler.

Nevertheless, it is easy ιο exaggerate the beneficia} results and ιο
overloolr the still existing evils ¹¹. Conviction ol the guilty did nct
necessarily imply restitution ιο the pillaged 1’; and the punishment

must have been olten inadequate ¹⁴, and have sailed to deter others.
