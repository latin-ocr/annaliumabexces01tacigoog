cuith] TACIYUS’ sotJRcEs OF INFORMATION, 15

Tuming from these to more‘ neutral authorities, we lind first in date
the name of M. Seneca the rhetor, whose history, from the beginning
of the civil wars to the last days of his own life, would seem, from an
expression used by his son, to be intended as a corrective of prevalent
untruthfulness¹; and was therefore probably anti-Caesarian in its tone.
He is believed to have died early in the principate of Gaius, so that his
work must have been mainly composetl before that time, and the death
scene of Tiberius, which he described ², may have been its closing point.

Next to him, we have two names more distinguished, apparently the
best known writers of this period ⁸.

hl. Servilius Nonianus, who was consul in 787, nn. 35 ⁴, and died in
812, nn. 59, after a successful forensic career, wrote history in his
later years ⁶. We hear that Claudius himself came to one of his recitals⁸.
,The elder Pliny once calls him the first man in the state²3 and Quin-
tilian, who had heard him, blames only his want of conciseness'. The
period covered by his historical works is unknown, but he is supposed
to be the ‘vir consularis' cited by Suetonius, as the authority for an
incident in the later years of Tiberius ⁸.

Aufidius Bassus, though somewhat older than Nonianus ¹⁰, seems
to have died a year later ¹¹. l-le wrote, besides a separate work on the
German wars ¹², a general history, to which a continuation in thirtyone
Books was written by the elder Pliny ¹⁸, who also wrote another work,
in twenty Books, on all the Roman wars in Germany ¹⁴. Some at least
of the work of Bassus, in which the death of Cicero was described,
must have been extant in the time of M. Seneca¹⁸, but it was probably
afterwards continued to a later date, perhaps to the time of Claudius,
