4. Noricum; 5. Judaea (when not under native princes)¹. The procurator
os judaea was certainly in some cases responsible to the legatus ol Syria ²,
and perhaps all such govemors were at first subordinated to their
nearest ‘legati’ An exception to all these classes is the position ol
Egypt, vhicb although recognised in terms as part ol the Roman Empire⁸‚
and equal in population and military force toa Caesarian province oi
the highest rank‘. was held by the emperor not as part ol bis dyarchy
with tbe senate, but as part ol his own domain and as representative ol
its kings, withan equestrian praelectus as vicegerent⁸; senators being not
only excluded lrom all office in it, but even forbidden to enter it ⁸.

The governors appointed by Caesar held office during pleasure and
sor no fixed term ¹, though a period ol srom three to five years seems
usual ⁸. Tiberius is especiallytnoted lorcontinuing them in office during
periodo os indefinite length'3 as may be illustrated lrom auch lists as
can be made ol tbe govemors ol important provinces during this period.
