cmv. ιιι] TACITUS' ΗΒΕ OF HIS MATERIALS. 27

In closing this part of the subject, one on which, notwithstanding all
that has been written, certainty of any kind is rendered impossible by
the loss of all the sources which our historian could have followed,
attention should be called to what at least is undeniable‚ the literary art
with which the heterogeneous material is arranged and handled, espe-
cially the skill with which a framework mainly annalistic¹ is adapted to
dramatic effect, so as to make each successive Book unfold a scene in
the tragedy ², and, in spite of much monotonyof subject ³, to sustain from
beginning to end the reader's interest.
