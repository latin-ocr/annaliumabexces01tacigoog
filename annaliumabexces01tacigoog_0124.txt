Their only interest is in their bread and their amusements ¹, and in both
they seem to have their grievanoes To keep lamine at bay is indeed
seit by the princeps to bc his most arduous tasli¹‚ and to require efforts
tar exoeeding those oi Augustus ¹. still, the cry ior bread, finding
expression at the great popular gatherings ol the games, is fierce and
even menacing ⁴ ; in the general poverty even a small tax seems burden-
some⁸3 and, beyond doing his utmost sor the lood supply, Tiberius
keeps ιΙιοιιι at a distance. The legacies of Augustus are pald grudgingly ⁸,
‘congiaria’ are infrequent⁷3 and, though the people have the cheap
daily lounge ol their public baths‚ thanks to Maecenas and Agrippa, and
their ‘circenses' and new ‘ludi Augustales⁸;' yet the presence ol the
princeps at their games, if vouchsaied at all, is no longer genial'‚ and the
sanguinary excitement ol gladiatorial shows so rare, that crowds flock
to one given by private speculation in the neighbourhood ¹⁰. Their
moods arc sehooled ¹¹ and rebuked ¹¹ by edicts‚ their murmurs treated as
vapour¹⁸‚ their complirncnts declined¹⁴. One genuine enthusiasm‚ that
lor Germanicus and his house ¹⁸, seems lest to them; otherwise those lor
whom none care, care lor none; and find it their one sound instinct to
side with fortune and to hate the fallen ¹⁸ ; worthy parents ol those who,
hats a century later, looked on civil war in the streets as only a more
exdting gladiatoria} combat ¹⁷.

Ιτιιι.

Tew changes of importance in the administration or condition os Italy
belong to this period ¹⁸. Augustus was hut recognising laets already
accomplished, in hiring the western srontier of Italy at the line os the

Varus (ναι) ” and os the small province os the maritime Alpswz a small
semi-independent state being reserved in the district oi the Cottian Alps
round Segusium (Susa) near Turin ²¹. On the east, latria was included,
the Arsia (Arsa) being fixed as the boundary towards illyricum ”.
