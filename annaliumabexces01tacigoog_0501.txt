484 APPENDIX Ill. EXCURSUS

consulship in 726, rr. c. 28 ¹, had endeavoured to deal with the subject in
the most energetie and stringent manner; but met with such a storm of
opposition as to compel him to withdraw and modify his proposals⁸. ln
some milder form, the ⁴ lex lulia de maritandis ordinibus' was passed in
⁷3⁶· nc. 18 ³; butan interval of three years was given before it should
be enforced ⁴.

Towards the close of his life, in 762, nn. 9, he took the further step
of procuring the enactment of a great and comprehensive measure,
designed apparently to absorb and codify much if not all of the ‘ius
civile’ on the subjecta of marriages and wills. This law, fully sanctioned
by senate and comitia ⁵, is generally named after the consuls its actual
proposers, but often called in full ‘lex lulia et Papia Poppaea de
maritandis ordinibus.'

The following account of its several chapters is talten mainly from the
treatise of Heineceius⁸: who has collected such fragments of the text as
have been preserved, and has restored the rest from what is known
respecting its substance.

facit, fecerit. Neve senatoris filia neptisve ex lilio proneptisve ex
