procurators abroad began by being sar less than they ultimately
became ¹.

Thus the two classes ol magistrates coexistedz and a similar duality
pervades the whole government. We have the two classes ol provincial
governments3 the senatorial proconsuls‚ appointed by lot, with annual
tenure ; and Caesar’s legati and procurators‚ specially designated, and
continuing during his pleasure. There are two jurlicial systema ; on one
side the consular-senatorial high court, the tribunals ol the praetor and
iudices, and ol the centumviri; on the other, the personal court ol the
princeps and those ol his delegates. There are two treasuries, each ol
which receives and expends public money¹; even two coinagn, as the
princeps coins gold and silver, and the senate copper ³.

In some departments‚ indeed, ol the thus divided government the
senate has, in outward show, more even than its old constitutional
power ⁴. In lorm‚ since the abolition ol the comitia, it elccts the magis·
trater ol the state, who, through such election, themselves become
senators; andita decrees gradually take the place os sormal laws⁸. ln
lorm, again, even the choice ol a princeps rests with it. ln several other
departments, its formal powers, it not increased, are yet retained⁶. The
domestic history ol this period is still mainly a record ol its debates and
decisions; nor is the right to express opinion lirnited strictly to the
question before the house'. Formally, again, it is still the sountain ol
honour ; triumphs⁸ and triumphal insignia ⁰, days ol public reJoicing¹‘
and other compliments to the ruling family ¹¹, public lunerals¹⁸ and
other memorials to the dead ¹¹, are awarded by its decree. By its decrees‚
again, vices ¹⁴, disorder ¹⁸, unlawlul religions¹⁸, are repeatedly rebuked or
dealt with.

Still more remarkable is the institution and development at this time
ol the senatorial high court ol criminal judicatureff, whose proceedings
occupy so large a space in the history os this period. lt may not im·
