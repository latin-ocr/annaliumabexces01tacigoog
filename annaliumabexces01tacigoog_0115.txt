Similarly the title ol ‘princeps iuventutis,' though sometimes taken to
mark out a successor¹, might be shared by more than one ¹, and was
usually dropped at manhood. Far more influence would be exerted
ογ the association ol an intended heir in the ‘proconsulare imperium,'
or ‘tribunicia potestas,' or, as was the case with Tiberius, in both ⁸.
But this step was rarcly talten, and might even bc dangerous, sor not
every lteir could be so trusted ⁴. ‘Proconsulare imperium' seems indeed
capable oi degrecs, and was given to Germanicus ¹, probably to Drusus ⁸,
probably also to Seianus ⁷, in a lower lorrn than the tull ‘consortium’
held hy Tiberius· with Augustus. The tribunician power seems to be
treated as more significant, and is shared still more sparingly3 with
Augustus only by Agrippa and Tiberius, with Tiberius only by Drusus '3
never again, till shared by Titus with Vespasian¹⁰t and even Tiberius,
when first admitted to share that power, tnust have leit that others stood
nearer to the succession than he.

But whatever the position ol the expectant successor, the formal
choice lay with the senate, and its ratification with the comitia ¹¹, and
tlte powers were again defined at each succession¹'. In any case, the
principate is no monarchy in which ‘the king never dies3' there is
always an interval, during which its character as an excrescence os the
revolution reappears, in that no ⁴ interrex’ is needed aa il the republic
had been leit without chicl magistrates. The competence ol the consuls
still survives; to thern a living princeps can pretend ¹⁸, or even offer¹‘
to resign3 and at his death they carry on government during the
interval ¹⁸, and the form oi the constitution is still complete.
