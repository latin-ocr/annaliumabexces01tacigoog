Tun question ol the use made by Tacitus oi the sources open to him
has been oi late chietly discussed as regards the Historias, and in relation
to the close resemblance os portions ol that work to Plutarch's Lives ol
Galba and Otho ¹, which, on the supposition that neither author has
used the other ³, would show that both had closely followed some
common source, that not only the substance, but sometimes the form,
and even an epigrammatis turn ol expression had been adopted as it
stands by both ⁴, and that in some cases even a citation ol discrepancies
between authors is given at second-hand⁸. Portions ol Livy can be
shown to stand in a similar relation to Polybius, and it is contended that
such close following ol a single author is very general among ancient
historians, and that the reputation ol great writers rests more on literary
still than industrious research.

The question respecting the Historias, which cannot here be dis·
cussed, turns, it should be remembered, only on a small portion, and
probably in the author's opinion a less important portion ol that work⁸ ;
