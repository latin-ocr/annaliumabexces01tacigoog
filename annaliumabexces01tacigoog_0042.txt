been followed to the exclusion oi the other ¹, or both to the exclusion oi
all besides thern. Contemporary history has to be gradually built up
by incorporating fragmentary narratives into systematic treatises, and
only by degrees attains completeness. Nonianus, a pleader and senator
oi long standing, would have had much personal knowledge oi a limited
kind¹z Bassus, who may not have been a senator at all ⁸, might easily
have had greater experience elsewhere, and in his turn may have had
shortcornings⁴ which Pliny and others could supplement.

Nor are we without positive evidence that Tacitus had noticed omis·
sions in his chiei authorities lor this period. They had cut short the
dreary recital ol state trials and lelt him to search elsewhere to complete
the record ¹⁶. No previous writer, Greek or Roman, seems to have done
lull justice to Arminius ⁸. No one earlier than Pliny had preserved the in·
cident turned to such account by Seianus against Agrippina⁷ ; her important
political move in secking a second husband would have been unknown
but ior her daughter’s memoirs⁸3 the presage respecting Galba’s future'
would have been recorded by no one who wrote belore its iulfilment

ot the three leading authors named lor the Neronian period¹⁰,
Clusius alone is never quoted with disapproval. Still, ii he were the
main source, the references to the others could hardly be second-hand ¹¹,

and they may have known much that he did not. He would represent .

the best clement in the ‘comitatus' oi Nero ¹² ; Pliny, besides being the

inan ol widest reading, would have had rnost knowledge outside Italy ¹³, .

Rusticus, with whatever reserve his statements were to be received,
would have known most os Seneca's tite and policy ¹⁴.
