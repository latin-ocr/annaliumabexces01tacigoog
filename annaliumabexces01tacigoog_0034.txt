cm. HL] TACITUS' SOURCES OF INF 0er T ΙΟΝ. 17

rnust have been nearly severity, Pliny was forty·five, Rusticus probably
younger, so that, if their date of publication answered to their age, the
second could probably have used the first, and the third both the others.
The work of Cluvius, if the long account given by Josephus of the death
of Gaius was taken from him, must have been voluminous, and the
thirty-one Boolrs of Pliny cover the history of probably not more than
twenty years.

It has been shown¹ that Tacitus has referred to the special history
of Domitius Corbulo¹; and he may also have used that of Suetonius
Paulinus¹2 but with these our definite knowledge of even the names of
original authorities for this period ends. Bruttedius Niger, aedile in 775,
an. aa ¹, was awriter of history, but our only reference is to his notice
of the death of Cicero¹ ; also Tuscus, the accuser of Scaurus, appears to
lave written a foolish history of some sort¹. The references to
Lentulus Gaetulicus, the poet and epigrammatist¹, and to Licinius
Mucianus ¹, hardly prove them to have been historians; Cremutius
Cordus appears to have left odat an earlier date¹; Vipstanus Messala ¹⁰

to have begun at a later.
Further contemporary materials would no doubt be found in separate

notices of famous men, not only in the form of funeral orations, bur '

also in that of more detailed biographies, such as those of Thrasea and
Helvidius by Arulenus Rusticus and Herennius Senecio, arrd such
other precedents as Tacitus alludes to for his own biography of
agrieorafl. The fulness of detail found in the description of all tire

actions of Germanicus, and even of the progress of his remains to
Rome, and of the proceediugs after his death, appears to suggest the
existence of some such special source of information¹¹; the more so
