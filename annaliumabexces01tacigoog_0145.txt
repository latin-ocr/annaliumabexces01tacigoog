more consideration than the rowers ¹, are so lar on a par with them that
we lind both rewarded with the ‘civitas' alter twenty·six years’ service ³.
The ships are usually either ‘triremes’ or ‘Liburnae ¹,' and are dis·
tinguished by names lilre modern ships ⁴. The captains, whether ol
triremes or Liburnians, are designated as ‘trierarchi ⁸.' We bave no
knowledge ol the strength ot' these fleets; which are little mentioned in
general, but acquire sorne prominence in the civil war ol 822, ιι. n. 69.

Various auxiliary fleets, whether ot' ships ol war⁸ or transports',
existed· in the provinces, and are mentioned in various inscriptions ⁸.

The total strength ol all these lorces can be only very roughly esti·
nrated. Taking the legion with its auxiliaries at ιοροο, we have a total
ol a5o,000 lor the main armies; to which the home army, the ‘clas-
siarii' and all the various detached forces may add a further total ol
roo‚ooo. Thss it should be remembered represents at that time the
whole military and naval soree ol the civilised world.

On the pay and grievances ol the soldier it is sufficient to refer to the
narrative ol the mutiny ’, and the contrast there drawn between the
legionaries and the praetorians3 while a more favourahle estimate ol
military privileges. at a somewhat later date, can be t'onned lrom the six·
teenth Satine ol Juvenal3 and some information as to the rewards on
retirement, chiefly the gilt ol ‘civitas' to auxiliaries, and the ratification
ol marriages generally ¹⁰, can 'be gathered lrom the various ‘diplornata¹¹.'
To those ol higher rank, many lurther advantages were attainable.
Centurions, besides being promoted to such posts as the command ol
auxiliary cohorts or squadrons¹², or the rank ol 'praelecti castrorum ¹⁸,'
had regular pensions on retirement ¹⁴, and the ‘primipili ' appear to have
rctained even lor tite the title ol ‘primipilares¹⁸,' and to have been
appointed to responsible posta in the army, or as subordinate governors
ol provincial districts ¹⁸.
