than in 832 and 834, run. 79 and 81; and would have been, on this
supposition, at least twenty-five years old at the earliest of these dates.

On the other hand, Pliny, who must have been born in 814 or 815,
nn. 61 or 62¹, speaks of Tacitus and himself as ‘aetate propemodum
aequales3' adding, however, that the oratorical reputation of his friend
was already established when his own professional career began '. lt
appears to follow, that the birth of Tacitus, while it cannot be placed
later than 807, sn. 54, can hardly have taken place much before that
date. ln other words, he must have been bomin one of the last years
of Claudius, or in the first of Nero ³.

His parentage and family are unknown. We can assume the nobility
of no ‘Cornelius' as such, since the extension of that name to the
ro,ooo freedmen of Sulla⁴3 and the cognomen is one of those which
appear to indicate a servile origin ⁸. Even if thisbe so, most of the
equestrian, and many even of the senatorial, families in this age could
claim no higher origin ’ς and although the Cornelii Taciti are unknown
in the Fasti, one of them at least had reached the ‘equestris nobilitas'
of a procuratorship in the time of the elder Pliny⁷; and, as the name
is rare, may probably have been related to the historiari. Itis again
to be inferred that he belonged to a family of some consideration, from
his admission to the quaestorship and senate, at the earliest, or almost
the earliest, legal age.

Throughout the letters of Pliny, in the allusions of Tertullian, Vopiscus,
Jerome, and Orosius, and in the second Medicean MS, he has no fuller
name than ‘Cornelius Tacitus.¹ The praenomen 'Gaius’ is given to
him by Sidonius Apollinaris, a scholar of the middle of the fifth century ¹,
but that of ‘Publius' given in the first Mediccan MS, is now shown to
be correct by an inscription '.

Assuming the genuineness of the Dialogue 'de Oratoribus,' we may
suppose him to describe in it the studies of his boyhood, and their
