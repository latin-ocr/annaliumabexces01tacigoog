cmviii] TIBERIUS AND HIS GOVERNMENT. 151

third, the loss of the Fifth Book makes our knowledge most imperfect;
but the actual charges against Agrippina and Nero, as has been already
shown ¹, bear no evident marks of fabrication or even exaggeration3
and the evident animosity underlying them may be as probably as·
signed to the suspicions nature of Tiberius himself, as to the prompt·
ings of his minister. The final conspiracy, though related as an un·
doubted fact by Josephus², and evidently believed by Tacitus⁸ as well
as Suetonius ‘, would yet seem to have been disbelieved by those whom
Dio has followed ⁶, and certainly never to have been formally proved
to the senate which condemned⁸; and, more strangely still, to have
been ignored by Tiberius himself, when seeking to justify the execution
to posterity².·

On the other hand, if the generally unscrupulous and ambitious

character of Seianus be assumed; every act in the drama as described,
from the concentration of the guards to the final plot, appears to follow

obviously from what had preceded it; to be suggested by an adequate
motive ; to be the natural step to taire at that particular stage. if
therefore the familiar story of his career is left to stand, it would seem
to be one of those cases in which a history, by its thorough coherency
and intrinsic probability, appears to prove itself.

From the point at which we recover the guidance of Tacitus all
the rest of his narrative is little more than that of a prolonged reign
of terror.

Tiberius is rhetorically described as never tired of trials and con·
demnations and never satiated ⁸, even stimulated by them to further
camage⁸, like a wild beast who has tasted blood. We are told of
universal panic‚ in which even the highest stooped to the informer's
trade, for sels-preservation, or even as if infected by a plague; that men
perished for old offences as much as for recent ; forwo'rdsas wellas
deeds; even for words spoken in private life¹⁰; that even the walls
seemed to have ears.

Here again the description seems to outstrip the facts. We still note
