ment and recall 01 Agrippina (note 14), but was soon alter again banished
and putto death at the instigation 01 Messalina, Dio, 60. 8, 5. Sue·
tonius (Cal. 7) mentions the death in childhood 01 three other children 01
Germanicus and Agrippina, born apparently in the years 761-764, att.
8-11 ; and inscriptions are t'ound recording the place 01 their cremation.
One 01 them appears to have been called Tiberius, another Gaius llnsc.
Orell. 668, 669, 670). It is also stated by Μ. Seneca (Controv. 4) that
Quintilius Varus (see on 466, 1) was a son-in·law 01 Germanicus; but
it is not known how this was the case. On the probable birth 01 another
child, see note on 1. 44, a.

17. A (16). A marriage had been projected in 715, tac. 39, between
Marcellus 1ηά the daughter 01 Sex. Pompeius. His marriage with Julia
daughter 01 Augustus took place 111 719, ac. 15 (Dio, 53. 17, 5), in which
year Plutarch states (Ant. 87) that Augustus also adopted him ; but thls
statement appears to require confirmation. He had been admitted to
the senate with praetorian ranlr; but his first and only actual magistracy
was the curule aedileship, held in his twentieth year, which was also the
year 01 his death. See r. 3, r; Propert. 3. 18,13-10; Verg. Aen. 6.
861-884.

ts. Alayl. lt is ltnown that there were two ‘Marcellae' (Suet. Aug.
637 Insc. Henzen 5373, 5374) and that one 01 thern, generally taken to
be Marcella minor, was married to Agrippa (see note 5) and to Iullus
Antonius (see note on 4. 44, 5). That the other was married to Μ.
Valerius Barbatus Appianus and to Sex. Appuleius, is a supposition to
explain the relationships mentioued in 4. 52, r; a. 50, r; where see
notes. Nothing appears to be known 01 the date 01 birth or death 01
either sister.

19. Ala8). Suetonius states (Aug. 63) that Agrippa had children by
Marcella. That one 01 these was a daughter, probably another Vipsania,
and was married to Q. Haterius, is an inserence lrorn the name 01
Haterius Agrippa, and lrom the mention made (a. 51, 1) 01 his relation·
ship to Germanicus.

20. A (19). Tacitus twice (4. 44, 3; ra. 64, 4) speaks 01 the wile 01
Domitius as ‘Antonia minor ς’ but Suetonius (Cal. r ; Cl. r ; Ner. 5lappears
to be right in assigning this marriage to Antonia maior, and in making
Antonia minor the wile ol Drusus. 'The marriage with Domitius (on
whom see 4. 44, 3; Suet. Ner. 4) is said to have been projected as early
as 717, ac. 37 (Dio, 48. 54, 4); at which time it would appear lrom
dates luruished by Plutarch (Ant. 33, 930; 35, 931) that the elder
Antonia was butan 11111111, 1ηά the younger yet unborn.
