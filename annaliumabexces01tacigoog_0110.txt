manvu] CONSTITUYION OF THE. EARLY PRINCIPATE. 93

probably have arisen out of a survival of the old criminal jurisdiction of
the consuls ¹, tlie senate being conceived as his assessors, as the ‘iudices'
erere those of the praetor⁸3 and cases could he brought before either of
these courts or the personal court of the princeps¹. ln practice, the
senate becomes under Tiberius by far tlie ¹most important criminal
tribunal of the state, dealing generally witli the greatest ⁴, especially
arith political, offences, and with criminals mostly of senatorial or eques·
trian rank or family ⁸. The court is competent to refuse to receive
a aase‘, and has some discretiori in respect of sentence on the accused⁷
or amount of recompence ιο the informer ⁸, biit is described as powerless
to reconsider a sentence once passed ¹.

Abroed, though no longer controlling the greater provinces, it formally
retains its old power over those remaining t00it. To these it appoints
govemors, as of old, by lot or otherwise ¹⁰3 from these it receives all
deputatione for rerlress of grievances; one such scene, that of the
audience of the many embassies oti the right of asylum, being described
as unusually impressive ¹¹. Petitions, at other times, are addressed to it
for relief of burdens ¹², and for erection or restoration of temples ¹⁸3 and
judicial questions of boundary ¹⁴, or property ¹⁶. We have even survivals
of the old correspondente with foreign princes ¹⁸, andxembassies of honour
to such as have deserved vell of Rome ¹².

The princeps keeps ilie senate constantly informed by reporta of all
the more important occurrences in the provinces ι·; and it surprises us to
