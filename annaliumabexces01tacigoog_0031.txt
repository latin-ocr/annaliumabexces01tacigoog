14 INTRODUCTION. [casalli.

Of these many, a few names only can be now supplied. In extant
literature, our only contemporary accounts of the time of Tiberius are
contained in one or two passages of Valerius Maximus ¹, and in the
work of tu. Velleius Paterculus, who, besides considerable notice of
the earlier life of Tiberius, gives, in the last nine chapters, a slight
sketch, without any regular narrative, of the first sixteen years of his
principate¹. published in 783, au. 30, and dedicated to M. Vinicius,
then one of the consuls⁸.

If arry others published, during the lifetime of Tiberius, any account
of his government, their names as well as their writings are lost to us;
but some works produced soon afterwards are on record: amongst
which a stock of material, of most questionable value, is contributed
hythe imperial family itself.

Tiberius himself composed a brief summary of his life ⁴, which, like
that of Augustus, may probably have been appended to his will, and
intended for inscription on his tomb. It must, however, have lacked
the skill of the famous ‘Marmor Ancyranum,' for our solitary reference
to it cites it only as containing a glaring and audacious falsehood ¹,

The memoirs of the younger Agrippina have been already mentioned.
We have also a stray reference to them in Pliny the Elder⁸, but by the
time of Tacitus they seem to be a forgotten book⁷. lt is impossible
to estimate how far they had already done their work by influencing
intermediate writers, or how much of the court scandal, in which
Suetonius revela, arrd which even Tacitus does not always disdain,
flowed originally from this polluted source ⁸.

Claudius is also recorded to have written an autobiography in
eight Books, ‘magis inepte quam ineleganter;' and a general history
from the close of the civil wara, of which two Books were written in
his youth, at the suggestion of Livy and with the assistance of Sulpicius
Flavus, and the remaining sorry-one Books during his principate’. lt
is not known whether it extended beyond the lifetime of Augustus,
though the apparent length of the work may make it probable.
