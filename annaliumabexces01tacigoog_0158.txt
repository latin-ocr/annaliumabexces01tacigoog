aview is consistent with the belief that the full extent ιο which such rivalry
might be pushed was not foreseen. Nor need a word here be said on
any insinuation of the complicity of Tiberius in adeath ascribed by tlte
superstitious to witchcraft, and by those who dispensed with evidence to
poisoning¹: still less on the imagination apparently for a moment enter·
tained ογ Tacitus that the really fatal charge against Piso, that of levying
civil warin the province, was somehow tlte outcome of a deep-laid plot
of Tiberius ιο destroy hirn¹.

We pass ιο the state trials, especially those for ‘maiestas' the one point
excepted in the summary¹ from the generally just administration of laws
during this period.

Tacitus is himself our best authority as to the offences originally and
subsequently made indictable under this term⁴; which appears ιο have
been gradually defined, with increasing width, by the ‘leges' ‘Appuleia'
(654, rac. roo), ‘Varia' (663, rac. 91), ‘Cornelia’ (during the rule of
Sulla), and ‘Iulia' (enacted by Augustus)⁵; and which, even in the time
of Cicero, hasa formidably clastic meaning, which would hardly require
pressing to make it cover the most trifling acts alleged to imply disrespect⁸
or the slightest approach to olfensive words ². This latter application is,
however, at least extremely limited' until the tinre of Tiberius, under
whom it is extended not only ιο libels written and published but even to
spoken words ’‚ an extension involving all the terrors of espionage in
private life 3 and the strict limitation to libels on the prince and his family ¹⁰
is disregarded in practice ¹¹. It should be remembered also that Roman
law was not without other means of dealing with either treasonable acts
or scandalous libels, and that the law of ‘maiestas' probably from its
more sweeping character, was one which it had been apparently thought
prudent to hold in reserve. We should gather that it had been for the
most part dormant under Augustus, as the praetor asks Tiberius in the
year following his accession, whether heis to entertain charges under it ¹¹.
