x PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDIYION.

made use of as is given above, or to be gathered from the
whole of this volume, will seem meagre in the extreme:
and even if only well-known writers be taken account of.
l fear that the most competent critics will be mainly
impressed by the omissions. But whatever hopes Ι had
formed that the book would give more assistance than
has been hitherto easily accessible to the general student
of this portion of Tacitus have been far more than
realized by the reception given to it, and by the demand
for a new edition at an earlier date than l had expected.
The defects still evident in it will not, l hope, be set
down to negligente, but will be excused as those of an
editor who has long since lost the experience which those

Classical authors are mostly cited from the texts of
the Teubner series; and it is hoped that the abbrevia-
tions used in referring to them, or to editors or other
modern writers, will generally explain themselves. As

ranum‘ (Mon. Ant.) is cited from Mommsen’s edition
above referred to; the ‘Oratio Claudii’ from the Appen·
dix to Book XI, in vol. ii.; most others from the ‘Cor-

of Orelli and l·lenzen or of Wilmanns; Greek inscrip-
tions are cited from Boeckh's ‘Corpus' (C. l. G.) or the
‘Corpus lnscriptionum Atticarum' (C. l. Att.); a few
more iu both languages from the ‘Ephemeris Epigraphica’
(Eph. Epig.J: any others given are usually cited at
secondhand. In numismatics references are made to
Eckhel J‘doctrina numorum veterumJ and to Cohen
(⁴ Medailles ImperialeS,' and ed.. 1879J; on other works
of art, mostly to J. J. Bernoulli J‘Rdmische lconographie,'
Stuttgart, 1882-1894), sometimes to the ‘lconographie
