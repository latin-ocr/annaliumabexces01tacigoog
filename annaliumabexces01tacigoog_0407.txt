the Ems, the army marched along the right bank of the Hase, supported
by a light flotilla conveying supplies ¹, to a point whence the valley of
the Werra and the Weser could be easily reached. The absence oi any
resistance need not show that all this district was reduced to submissiou,
but rather that Arminius had thought fit to collect all his strength behind
the Weser, where his own advantages and the difficulties of the Romans
would be augmented. We have two battles'‚ in which great victories
are claimed, but the first does not prevent the speedy reassemblage of the
enemy, and the sequel of the second is a retreat, not as in the previous
year, at the equinos, but in the height of summer ⁸, ending in a still
greater disaster, and followed by short incursions ⁴, apparently intended.
like that of two years previously, to restore the morale of the troops.
This premature retreat may have been due to unmentioned reverses, to
the increasing difficulty of feeding an isolated army, or lo other causes,
but all explanation is mere conjecture.

The one more campaign, still longed for by the sanguine leader', if it
had gone on the lines of those before it, might probably have been
plaaned on the supposition that the army should be conveyed or attenderl
by the fleet up the Weser and Aller to the neighbourhood of the Elbc.
But for this a new fleet was needed; the dangers of sea transport had
proved to be even greater than those of a land march; the Romans had
secured no ground beyond the Weser; and an advance to the Elbe
would have brought them dangerously near to the great organisation of
the hitherto neutral Maroboduus ⁸.

All this Tiberius must have known, also that German warfare had
entered on a new stage since his own day, by the growth of military
discipline ², and the rise of a leader of genius So-calfed victories might
still be won ; but the Germana had always an easy refuge in the foresta,
and could soon collect again to harass a retreating enemy. To hold the
country, roads would have to be restored· or created in every direction,
strong winter camps formed in several places, the chief rivers pennanently
occupied by a fleet. Even thus the result might yet be doubtful owing
to the absence of towns among the Germana, their unsettled homes and
