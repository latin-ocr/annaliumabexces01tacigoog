nec ulla in corpore signa sumpti exitii reperta.

3. amissas nobtlss familias, re-
ferring apparently to the story of the
Fabii at the Cremera (Liv. a. 50).

4. prinoipem not here in a special
sense, but=‘ great men!

much oltener than ⁴ deinde}

5. sollemnis, ‘their rlsual employ-
ments!

Megalesium. These began on the
4th of April (Ov. Fast. 4, 179 sqq.); but
we can hardly suppose that the mouming
had lasted continuoasly till then (see on
a. 81, 8). Ovid (l. tt describes the pro·
cession at these games, and speaks of
scenio and Circensian entertainments: see
hlarquardt. iii. 367, foll.

suberat, ‘was at hand'; so used by
cte. 1111116, 41) and Caesar (tt. G. 3.
17, 1; li. C. 3. 97, 4). The indicative is
used because these words area note by
the writer, not a part of the edict.

and others retain the tta. text, as astrong
instance oi a gerundire genitive denoting
purpose and qualifying the whole seu·
tence (lntrod. v. ᾗ 37 d), but the sense

seems here to require an expression of
the instrumental cause of excitement3
aad ‘spe’ could most easily have been
absorberi between ‘animis' and ‘peteu-
dae.' The more common expression is
‘Hereetus in (or‘sd') spem‚'as 1. 71, t;

11. probationes, ‘prooix' or ‘evi-

next sentence explains the word, by sup·

osing that he had caused the death of
blartinaz but of this there appears to be
ao evidence beyond common talk.

in a hollow in tho βελόνη. 11 was thus,
according to oue version (Dio, 51. 14, ai,
that Cleopatra secreted poison about her.

¹4· neo . ..reperta The inierence
would seem to be that she had not com·
mitted suicide, bttt had been murdered
iu some subtle manner. Nipp, oa the
other band, thinlts it to be assumed that
she had poisoned herself: and that the
important admission, that no signs of
poison uere founil in her body, is turned
into sn argument that she must have used
drugs that left no trace, which would
explain the absence ol conclusive evidence
in the case of Germanicus (a. 73, 5).
⁴ Sumere mortem ' is used of salcido in 13.
30, ,ῃ usually ‘sponte’ is added, as in
1. 66, a, 6. 25, t,&e.
