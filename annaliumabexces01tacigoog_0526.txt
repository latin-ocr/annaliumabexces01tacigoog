evidence of the existenoe of such imperial
offioers, at least in Asia (see also note ou
a. 47, 5ι, before tbe time of Claudius,

from which date they are fully attested

'by inscriptions iu all senatorial provinces

(see Marquardt, 1. 555, n. 5). On their
limited powers at this time see next note.
In 13. ι, 3, similar officers are described
as ‘rei familiari principis inebria inpositi.⁸
An inscription of Α.ιι. ιο5 (C. 1. L. v.
