cau. tv.] TACITUS’ USE OF HIS MATERIALS. 31

destiny are mingled and confused ¹, and the latter appears often to mean
no more than the operation of some inexplicable cause ¹, or sometimes
only that which would happen in the ordinary course of nature if men
made no affort to supersede it ¹. When he has to explain the steady
career and position of a Manius Lepidus, he feels that it must be due not
altogether to destiny, botin part at least to his own personal qualities ⁴.

On the whole, his doctrine has thus neither the precision nor the
embarrassing consequences ofa philosophical theory, and is rather such
as would be expected ln one who held that, while a tincture of deeper
studies formed part of necessary culture ¹, it was not well fora Roman
senator to go too far in them ⁶. His creed serves him at times to point
a moral, rather than affects his general view of historical events ⁷.

Writing with a moral purpose, it is needless to say that Tacitus holds
himself bound to tell the truth without prejudice or favour⁸. That he is
no careless follower of previously written narratives has been already
shown '; while the accuracy in detail, both of himself and his informante,
is in no slight degree evidenced by confirmatory inscriptions, such as those
already cited ¹⁰ ; and by the paucity and insignificance of such errors of
fact as have been clearly brought home to him ¹¹. What is probably the
weakest point in his narrative, the want of precision in its geography ¹¹,
isa defect which he shares with Livy, Sallust, and otber authors, who
have had to describe military movements on an extensive scale without
the aid of maps ¹¹.

Two points may here be noted, in which this obligation to veracity is
consciously relaxcd.

Firstly, in the account of battles, at least of disastrous battles, he
