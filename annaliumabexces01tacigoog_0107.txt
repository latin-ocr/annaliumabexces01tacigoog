appointed by Caesar, having no colleagues ¹, with duties specifically
assigned by him, and holding office during his pleasure.

The old magistrates are indeed styled ‘mere names⁸;' still it is
admitted that, in the best days os Tiberius, ‘consuls and praetors had
their proper state, even the lesser magistrates had their powers in
exercise ⁸ ;' and this admission can be supported by detail.

The office oi consul, though no longer, as a rule, tenable throughout
the year, and lowered as a distinction by the multiplicatiori oi ⁸consules
suffecti,' or os ‘consulares' who had received only the ‘omamenta,' yet
ahares such dignity as remains to the senate ; with whom the consuls are
the official chaunel oi communication ⁸, and its regular presidente when
it meets either as a deliberative ⁸ or judicial⁸ body. They can also still
issue edicta to the people ⁸, and a survival even oi their old summary
power of lile and death is yet traceable ⁸. lt is indeed probable that the
other magistrates, both through increase os their number, and through
transserence oi many oi their duties to imperial officere, must have osten
had merely honorary iunctione, still, oi the twelve praetors, the two
ioremost have their old ‘iurisdictio '‚' and others preside at the ‘quaes-
tiones perpetuae ιο;’ also the important charge oi the aerarium ¹¹, and the
‘cura ludorum,' transferred srom the aediles ¹⁸, belonged to this body.
The aediles, oi whom probably two were curule and four plebeiam
though no doubt relieved oi their ‘cura annonae' by the ‘praefectus'
retain a certain ‘cura urbis' with power to regulnte markets and prices ¹⁸,
to control places oi public resort ¹⁸, and to impose tines¹⁸.

The ten tribunes oi the people appear still to have retained their seat

oi honour in senate ¹⁸ and theatre ¹⁸, their viatores ¹⁸, and also their ¹ ius
relationis ¹⁸, and some coercive porvers⁸⁸, and, on sufferance, even their
