see also Henzen 5365) appear to give the name of her father, ‘Livius
Drusus Claudianus’ (see Vell a. 75, 3); and that of her mother as
Alfidia. Τ) Nero was quaestor, pomifer, praetor (Suet. Tib. 4), and
gave up his wife to Octawi2nus in 726, nc. 38, before the birth of
Drusus. He died when his eldest son was nine years old (lbid. 6).

Livia became by adoption in 767, nn. 24, ‘Iulia Augusta, Divi Aug. f.'
(lnsc. Orell. 625, etc.) Though not deified at her death (see 5. a, 1),
she became so after the accession of Claudius (Dio, 60. 5, 2), and shared
atemple with Augustus in the Palatium (Insc. Orell. 244⁶)· Even in
her husband's lifetime she was entitled ‘Lisia Augusti dea' inan in·
scription in Sicily (Orell. 624), and at other times received abroad other
titles not formally allowed (see notes on r. 24, 2); and her birthday
was kept after her death (see 6. 5, 2).

27. On the parentage of Vipsania (who is called simply ‘Agrippina'
in Suet. Tib. 7 ; Insc. Orell. 658), see note 4. She was betrothed to
Tiberius Nero in infancy (νὴ annicula' Nep. Att. 29), but the date of
their marriage is not known. On the distressof Tiberius at being forced
to divorce her and to marry Julir, see ch. viii. p. 133; on her sub
sequent marriage to C. Asinius Gallus Saloninus see r. 12, 63 and on her
death, 3. 19, 4. She had several children by her second marriage, for
whom seeon 3- 75· ¹3 ⁸4· ¹2 ¹3 34, ¹5 ⁶· ²3.3·

28. Β (2). Tiberius down to the dme of his adoption bears the name
‘Ti Claudius Ti. f. Nero,' his titles being those of his two consulates,
with those of pontifex and imperator, and, after 748, nc. 6, the years
of tribunician power: see lnsc. Henzen 5375. After his adoption be
becomes ‘Tiberius Caesar, Augusti f., Divi nepos' (lnsc. Orell. 683),
but usually drops the gentile name Julius. During his principate, the
name Augustus, though not allowed by him in ordinary use (Suet. Tib.
26 ; Dio, 57. 2), always appears on coins and inscriptions. 'l'he ‘prae-
nomen imperatoris' was not adopted, though found sometimes in pro·
vincial inscriptions (see C. 1. L. viii. 2, Index, p. 1038). The years of
his tribunician power continue to be reckoned, inclusive of those which
he shared with Augustus; and the number of times on which he was
saluted imperator (see on 2. 18, 2) are added. Hence his¹ mortuary
inscription (Orell. 691) runs thus: ‘Ossa Ti. Caesaris, Divi Aug. F, Aug,
Pont. hlax, Trib. Pot. xxxiia, lmp. viii, Cos. v.'

29. Β (3). Neither Drusus nor his second son was ever adopted
into the family of the Caesars. ln lite, Drusus was entitled augur, consul
(745, nc. 9), and imperator: after his death the surname ‘Germanicus'
was conferred on him and his family (Suet. Cl. t ς cp. Henzen 5375).
His eldest son was thus entitled to bear the nante, before his own
