This law, though having sor its apparent object ‘to add force to the
penalties ou celibacy and to enrich the treasury⁸,' encountered no such
vigorous opposition as that which had blunted the edge of the ‘lex
lulia ⁴.' The senate had been schooled ογ twenty-five years ol submissior,
and people had perhaps found out that it was easier to evade laws than
to resist their enacunent. The consuls from whom this law is named
were both unmarried ⁶; nor, according ιο Tacitus ⁸, did marriage or the
rearing ol children become more frequent.

In one respect the law was indeed most fruitsul. By it was given the
first general encouragement, on a large scale, and in a matter affectirrg
private lile, to systematic delationi, and the first brood os professional
inlormers was called into being 3 whose activity in respect ιο other laws,
and especially that ol ‘ maiestas,' forms so large a part ol the domestic
history of the age. When this activity was let loose upon alaw whose
vast and complicated networlt was such as to entangle every family in
some or other ol its meshes⁸‚ we can easily see that its working must
have caused intolerahle annoyances unioreseen at its enactment, and can
understand the outcry which in ten years was already demanding relaxa·
tion. The law itsels thus marks the extreme limit os legislative interier-
ence with private lite in this respect, and its subsequent history as known
to us is that ol its mitigation. ‘Many ol its entanglements were

resolved' ογ the commission under Tiberius ⁹, another important pro·
vision was relared ογ Claudius ¹⁰, the rewards of informers were cut down
ογ Nero ¹¹, and princes osten gave the ‘ius liberorum' to those who had it
not ¹⁸. Thus the severity of many oi its penalties became so sar obsolete
