considers it a point of patriotism to conceal the number of Roman
slain. This reticence, observable throughout bis narrative, especially in
the account of the campaigns of Gennauicus, appears to have been
deliberately adopted asa principle, and grounded on precedent, iu a lost
part of the Histoties ¹.

The second exception relates to the practice, so common among
ancient historiam, and never regarded by them as a breach of truth,
of composing imaginary speeches purporting to be historical'. There
is, however, reason to believe that Tacitus recognized some limit iu
this respect, as may be seen by the comparison elsewhere made between
the speech assigned to Claudius on the concession of full citizenship to
the Gauls⁸ with the extant fragments of the actual speech ⁴, which would
lead us to conclude, that iu such documents as the recorded letters and
speeches ol the princeps to the senate, Tacitus while feeling at liberty
to condense, rearrange, and generally to deal with the form as he
thought fit, and to assimilate the style and language to his own for the
sake of literary homogeneity ⁸, does consider himself under an obligatiou
to preserve the substance of what was really said, and that such passages
ate, to this extent, historical⁶: though a much smaller measure of truth
may be supposed -in less known or less famous senatorial speeches²;
and still less, ot rather none, in such orations as those of Calgacus to
his countrymeu⁸, or in the address of Germanicus to the mutinous
legions, or that to his friends around his death-bed ⁰.

Besides the emphatic profession of the historian's obligation to impar·
