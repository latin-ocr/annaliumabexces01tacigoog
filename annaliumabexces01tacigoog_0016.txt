Romaine' of Visconti and Mongez; on questions of
Roman topography‚ mostly to Professor Middleton
(The Remains of Ancient Rome,' London, 1892), some·
times also to Mr. Dyer and Mr. Burn. ln references to
Dr. Smith's Dictionaries, the authors of the articles are
mostly cited by name; on questions of general Latin
Lexicography it is to be understood that the Latin
Dictionary of Messrs. Lewis and Short is usually
referred to.

lt hardly needs to be said that, out of the large
number of references given, whether to ancient authors,
to inscriptions, or to modern works, a vast majority had
been already given in previous editions or lexicons, and

are due to no research on my part. lmay, however, say ‘

that, with some allowance for possible oversights, 1 be-
lieve that l have verifred all which are not expressly
cited at secondhand, and that 1 have also verified and
consulted a very large number more, which, for various
reasons, it did not seem necessary to insert.

Oxrono, May, 1896.
