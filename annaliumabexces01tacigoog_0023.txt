6 IN T RODUC Τ ΙΟΝ. [crin. 1.

There is no evidence that his intention to write the history of Nerva
and Trajan 1, 01 his later project of writing that of Augustus ¹, were ever
carried out.

The titles assigned to the two greater works require some remark.
ln the second Medicean MS, both ‘Annals' and ‘Bistones' without
any distinguishing title, are numbered continuously ss the ‘Books of
Cornelius Tacitus? The latter, however, are called ‘Historiae' by
Pliny⁸, and are definitely cited, as a separate work under that title, by
Tertullian⁴.

Tor the title ‘Annales’ there is no earlier authority than the edition of
Rhenanus (1544), who thought that he found it in the text. Tacitus
does indeed, in one place, spealr of his work as ‘Annales nostri 1,’ and,
in another, of his general purpose to relate events in their chronological
order 1. But there is no evidence that he intended the title distinctively
for this work3 and he elsewhere uses ‘annales' as a general term for
1111111111.1 It is with equal generality that Jomandes speaks of him as
‘annalium scriptor ⁸.' ln the first illedieean lllS. the books are entitled
‘ab excessu Augusti’ a title analogous to that of the Histories of Livy,
‘ ab urbe condita.'

Of the manuscripts, it will be sufficient here to notice the first Medicean,
comprising only the Books contained iu this volume and forming the
sole authority for them '.

Ruodolphus, a learned monk of Fulda in Hesse Cassel, writing in
the ninth century, cites Tacitus as speaking of the Visurgis, and would
therefore appear to have known smnnuscript containing these Books ¹⁰.

¹The next intimation is from Poggio Bracciolini, who writes in ¹4²5
on a communicatIon made to him from Germany, respecting some
unknown works of Tacitus said to be preserved at Hersfeld, near F uida.
