PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.

—00—

ln· sending out, after nearly thirteen years' interval,
a new edition os this portion of the Annals, much oi the .
Prelace os 1883 has to be repeated, with additional
acknowledgment oi new sources oi information since
that date.

The text is now that of Halm’s fourth edition (188 3),
which has, however, been departed irorn in several places,
lor reasons given in each case ¹. ln accordance with
several suggestions, l have now added bries critical
notes, which, it is hoped, will sufficiently show the
actual hledicean text, wherever it has not been retained,
and the originator oi that adopted in its place, as well
as a few os the other emendations proposed. For all
luller information on this subject, the apparatus criticus
os Baiter (in Orelli's edition) and Ritter (1863) must be
consulted ².

The sections into which the chapters are sub-divided
will be familiar to those acquainted with the Oxsord
text (Parker, 1869): they have been also specified in
