crunt] GENUINENESS OF THE ANNALS. 11

a ‘delecta manus ¹,' subsequently called an ‘ala ¹.' His name appears
to suggest tbc origin oi an ‘ala Indiana' mentioned in several in·
scriptions¹.

4. Caninius Gallus is mentioned as one of the quindecimviri, and as
‘scientiae caerimoniarumque vetus ¹‚'a description suitable to a person
who can be shown to have existed at that time, and to have been
‘magister fratrum Arvalium ¹.'

Other instances might, no doubt, be added, but the above will pro·
bably be considered sufficient

Another curious apparent confirmation will tend, is admitted, to
carry back the date ol these Books nearly to that ol their reputed
author. ln the account oi the Frisian rebellion occurs the sentence
‘ad sua tutanda digressis rebellibus ⁶.’ Ptolemy, wrlting in the gene·
ration next to that of Tacitus, in his list ol towns in north Germany
inserts zmowdvoa as the name oi a place¹3 which certainly looks
as il he had the passage oi the Annals before him, and misunder-
stood it.

ln the later Boolts ol the Annals, the principal inscription to be con·
sidered is that containing parts oi the speech ol Claudius, which indeed
irorn its dissimilarity in many respects to that given in the Annals has
been cited as evidence on the other side. lt must here suffice to refer
to the reasons shown elsewhere¹ sor thinking that the composition in
the Annals was based on a knowledge oi the original speech, though
much lreedom was used in dealing with it

Whatever may be thought ol this, there are other and more indisputable
confirmations ol statements sound only in these Books, similar to those
above noted in Books l-VI. We may ask lrom what source Bracciolini
could have ascertained, or by what felicity he could have imagined that
Cadius Rulus was governor oi Bithynia ⁹, Eprius Marcellus oi Lycia ¹⁰,
Tarquitius Priscus oi Bithynia ¹¹, L. Antistius Vetus oi Asia ¹¹, that Clodius
Quirinalis was ‘ praelectus classis ¹¹,‘ and Gavius Silvanus tribune oi a prae·
torian cohort ¹⁴, that Silanus had a daughter Lepida¹¹, that the names ol
