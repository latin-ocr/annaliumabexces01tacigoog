cuith] CONSTITUTION OF THE EARLY PRINCIPAYE. 89

Claudius¹; which passed, ata later tinne, into a permanent body of
salaried jurists''.

This body is distinct from the more definite political committee of
twenty senators, regularly appointed in virtue of magistracy or by lot ³,
for discussion of questions to be afterwards submitted to the fnll house ’ς
though these persons might also occasionally act as judicia! assessom‘.
These again must be distinguished from the confidential advisere of the
princeps, as Sallustius Crispus, Seneca, irc, and from the cabinet council
of ‘proceres’ summoned on emergencies⁸.

Notwithstanding these powers, the early ‘princeps’ has no such
monarchy as that of Diocletian or Constantine; nor, on the other hand,
does the principate follow the democratic lines traced by the dictator

Caesar, whose memory Augustan literature seems to have been instructed
rather to obliterate than to glorify ⁷.

The popular assemblies, suspended by the triumviri, restored, but
gradually controlled by Augustus⁸, are practically abolished at his
death ’. me this time, whatever share they may have retained in the
forms of legislation¹⁰, their most important function, that of electing
the magistrates of the state, survives at most in the plebiscite, following
a ‘senatusconsultum' by which tribunician power is conferred on the
princeps or his associate ¹¹; or, in other electioris, in a mere formal
‘renuntiatio' of the choice made by the senate ¹¹. The importance of
this change is only paralleled by the ease nith which it appears to have
been effected.

Whrle the pcople thus cesse to have any direct share in government,
and find their only representation in the democratic side of imperialism,
the Caesars hare made their pesce with the aristocracy, and in outward
form share a dual governrnent with it. There are rno sets of magis·
trates; on the one hand, the old republican and senatorial hierarchy of
consuls, praetors, &c.; on the other, the praefects and other delegates
of the princeps: the former, as of old, elected to office, grouped in
‘collegia' partitioning duties by lot, with annual tenure: the latter
