vl PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDIYION.

all references to other parts of Tacitus: which will, as
it is hoped, greatly lessen the labour of consulting
them ¹.

ln preparing the commentary all the principa] editions
have been freely used. Among earlier ones, especial
obligation must be acknowledged 1ο Walther's full
summary 01 the chief textual criticism down to his
own date (llalle, 1831), and the valuable edition of
Ruperti (llanover, 18 34), in which all the Excursus of
lipsius, and the chief results of the labour of other
commentators down to that time are brought together.
Among later editions those most consulted have been
Ritter (Cambridge, 1848). Orelli (2nd ed, by Baiter.
Zurich, 1859), Ε. jacob (and ed, Paris, 1885), Draegcr
(5th ed.. Leipzig, 1887), Ptitzner (and ed.. Gotha, 1892).
and Nipperdey (9111 111, by G. Andresen, Berlin, 1892).
also thc editions of two American scholars, that of Pro-
fes-sor llolbrooke (London, 1882) and that of Professor
Allen (Boston, 1890).

To these, most especially to Nipperdey and Anclresen,
l am repeatedly and constantly indebted; and it is the
more necessary for me here to acknowledge my general
obligation in the most emphatic manner, inasmuch as
the· special sources of each note are often too complex
mmmmmffl.

Among separate works bearing ou the criticism ancl
interpretation of the text, those most used have been
thc old ‘Lexicon Taciteum' of Botticher (Berlin. 18 30).
