was sufficiently secure at the outset to have made it their best policy
calmly to bide their time ior a succession which every year ol' experience
and public life would have the more assured to Nero: we can also see
that Seianus had an obvious motive ior insidious attacks on them; and
may even have forced them to intrigue in sels-detence: and that, with or
without such incentives, the fiery and domineering nature oi Agrippina¹
may have made her play only too readily into his hands.

These causes at any rate tended to promote the ascendencyol the only
real minister whom Tiberius ever had. It is by playing on these weak·
nesses that Seianus is represented to have induced him to taire the great
step which marks the close ol this period ; that ol permanently withdraw·
ing from Rome¹, and hiring his headquarters in the natural island-
sortress os Capreae ⁸. Accepting, on general authority, the counsel of
this adviser as the primary motive lor such seclusiom Tacitus adds, with
perhaps more thau due suess, others which we may place in the second
rank ⁴. The dictation still exercised by Augusta, even at the age oi
eighty-five, is intolerable to an almost septuagenariam son, and amounts
to a vinual claim to share the power which she had won ior him. His
habits os liie are said to have driven him to fly the restraint oi society:
even his personal appearance to have led him to shun the eyes ol men.
'l'he tall gaunt form, awlrward even in its erectness⁸, has contracted an
ungainly stoop; the countenance,.so refined and distinguished in his
busts and coins, is said to have become a loathsome spectacle. What·
ever may be the explanation or excuse, the fact itsell remains that sor
the last ten years oi his rule he withdrans irom all publicity, srom all
personal intercourse with the senate and almost all with its magistrates,
and that the accessibility and civic lile hitherto associated with a Roman
princeps pass into the seclusion ol an Bastern sultan.

The period which begins with the concentration ol a body-guard
seems aptly to end with almost a seli-imprisonment: and we appear to
see a picture, neither inconsistent nor indistinet‚ oi a phase intermediate
between his best and worst; one oi an old age ol increasing timidity,
suspicion, and isolation aggravated by a counsellor whose interest it was
