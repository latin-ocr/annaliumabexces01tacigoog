cmvii] ROME UNDER AUGUSTUS ΛΝΒ TIBERIUS. 127

a. Urban cohorts. Ol these, the ¹proprius miles ' ol the ‘praelectus
urbis¹,' three were kept in Rome under Tiberius ¹, and the total number
probably became six under Claudius and Nero ¹. and t'our under Vitellius
and Vespasian ⁴; and they are so lar joined to the praetorians as to be
numbered in a series beginning where the former end, as the tenth to the
thirteenth ¹¹. The praetorian cohorte have titles, as ‘pia vindex,’ tre, the
urban are known by their numbers only ⁸.

The horne army had the privilege oi being professedly enlisted from the
old recruiting grounds ol the Republicl. The rest ol Italy, so sar as its
scanty free population admitted it, might help to keep up the legions and
other cohorts ol citizens, but ior soldiers ol all kinds the main supply was
now drawn irom foreign sources ¹, the auxiliary troops being drawn from
the Caesarian provinces only, the legionaries ironr all provinces alike,
and, even in the time ol Augustus, by no means exclusively from
those who were already 'citizens by birth ¹. Voluntary enlistment seems
usual, but ‘delectus' in the provinces preferable ¹⁰; and the number
required was no doubt kept down to a minimum by withholding the
‘missio'¹¹.'

B.-1isval.

'The fleets ol lllisenum and Ravenna ¹¹ are each dignified with the title
‘classis praetoria¹¹,' but otherwise rank below not only the household
troops but the legions. The admiral, ‘praelectus¹⁴‚' ranks below the
‘praelectus praetorii ’ζ’ and is either a knight or sometimes a lreedman ¹¹.
The marine soldiers‚ ‘classiarii' are not Roman citizens, and, though ol
