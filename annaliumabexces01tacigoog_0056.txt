cm.v.] THE SYNTAX AND STYLE OF TACIYUS. 39

wholly peculiar to Tacitus, but also the most remarkable ol those which,
though adopted srorn earlier writers, are used by him -with characteristic
boldness and freedom.

Among the features ol the Latinity ol what is called the silver age,
one ol the most prominent is the introduction into prose oi words and
forms ol expression froin the great classic poets‚whol1ad by that time
&come the text-books oi every grammar-school ¹. That this extendetl
to all kinds ol prose composition, may be illustrated irom the lact that
out ol a list, gathered lrom Tacitus, oi nearly roo words, more or less
frequentin Augustan poetry, but absent lrom Augustan or classic prose,
more than hali had already von a place in intermediate prose literature,
mostly in the plain, matter itaet descriptions os the elder 'Plinyk
Another such· list might easily be framed from Livy, to show by a com-
parison with Caesar, or even Sallust, the influence oi poetic diction on
historica! prose, in the latter part oi tlte Augustan age itsell.

Partly through this adoption oi poetic language, partly through the
increaaing taste lor what was Greek, as such ⁸, Latinity had also become
more tolerant os Greek words and grammatical Graecisms.

In Tacitus, the first ol these general tendencies is abundantly pro·
minent‘; the latter he may probably have looked upon as a corruption,
as hc shows no disposition to add to the Graecisms or Greek words
already in use ⁸. His earliest treatise, tlte ‘Dialogus' shows even
a reaction in the direction oi'Ciceronian Latinity⁶; his later writings,
while showing less and less trace os Cicero ⁷, have acquired so marked
an individuality oi style ⁸, that even a fragment, long lurking unsuspected
in the pages of Sulpicius Severus, has been claimed lor Tacitus with
good grounds on internal evidence alone ⁹.

The special qualities oi his style are no doubt due. in no small
measure, to his professional career. As the first lorensic orator os the
day, we might assume that he had perlected such gilts as were pre·
scribed to a pleader by the prevailing sashion3 and he has himself
described to us the difference between the rolling periods ol Ciceronian
eloquence and the style demanded in his own age, when jury and
