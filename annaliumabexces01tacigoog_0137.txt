120 INTRODUCYION. [enavit.

Asia¹ were such as could hardly have been exceeded under the Re·
public :. in the same province, within the next ten years, another pro·
consull and a procurator¹ are convicted ot' extortion; and proconsuls
ol two other provinces‘ are condemned on equally serious charges:
nor does Silius corne with cleaner hands t'roni Germnny': in Spain
a legatus is assassinated through some money grievance‚ ol which we
have only tbe Roman version⁸z the Frisii are goaded into rebellion
by the exactions ol a subordinate officer⁷3 and the chiel Gaulish tribes
driven to the same course by a load ol debt ⁸, probably not uncon·
nected with ruinous requisitione lor the wara ol Germanicus’: Pontius
Pilate was allowed ten years ol misgovemment in Judaea¹⁰t and fuller
records lrom the provinces themselves would probably have shown
many other such blots on the administration, under even oue ol the
most frugal and vigilant ol the Caesars¹¹.

With the provinces should be enumerated the semi-independent states
and kingdoms, whose position must have varied greatly. Some were
small lree states, as Samos ¹¹, Rhodes ¹⁸, Lycia ¹⁴3 analogousto the many
lree cities within the provinces. In others the prince had the title of
‘praelectus' (as Cottius ¹⁸), or tbe position in lact (as Herod and his
sons) oi a procurator¹⁸; or may have been under a similar control to
that exercised over the Thracian princes ι’. Juba and his sons in
Mauretania ¹⁸, and the princes lest in Cilicia ¹’,'may have been free
lrom other obligations than to lurnish troops on demand ¹⁰. The Cap-
padocian king was even liable to be brought belore tbe bar ot' the

senate Ἰ. The relation ol Commagene is unknown ¹¹. Beyond this
tbe Armenian kingdom and the smaller Caspian principalities¹¹ seem
to have accepted a kind ol Roman suaerainty as their best protection
against Parthia. ln all these, complications were apt to ariae demanding
the interposition ol the Roman govemment. Rulers set up by Rome were
naturally unpopnlar, and their subjecta showed their insubordination as
