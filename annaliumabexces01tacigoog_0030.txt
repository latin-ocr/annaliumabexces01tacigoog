CHAPTER 111.

ΟΝ THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION OPEN To Tsctrus fort
'rtsss PER10D3 AND THEIR PROBABLE VALUE.

Nom-H, Haupt. writing in 1885 (Philol 44, pp. 131-163) 011 the portion of Dio
which goes side by side with Tacitus, reriews some twenty-seven trectises up to that
date, bearing 011 this subject or connected with lt. The stody of his nhstrtct of them
tenda rsther to bewilder 111111 10 instruct. Α 11111 und clear exposition of the whole
subject is given in a recent worlr hy M.'Philippe F ubit (Les sources de Tacite, Paris,
1⁸93), the larges part of which, however. deals with the Histories.

1. Wnrrrtrr narratives of the general history of the period or of
parts of it.

It is not the habitos Tacitus to name his informants; and in the
first six Boolrs he has done so twice only, citing the history of the
German wars by C. Plinius ¹, and the memoirs of the younger Agrip
pina ², in each case for an incident relating 10 the elder Agrippina. ft
is stated in the latter ease, and apparently implied 111 the former, that
he is taking from a less usual source something overlooked by those
whom he generally follows. ln the later Books we have references
1ο the general history of Pliny ⁸, to Cluvius Rufus ⁴, to Fabius Rusticus ⁸,
arrd to Domitius Corbulo ⁶.

General references are far more common3 and give evidence that
there were many such worlts, and that his history was mainly drawn
from them².
