them stand on the defensive, and gire no aid to those who give none to
them ¹. With this exception, they are left out of count, and the Upper
army is thus set free to join the other in the general attack.

Against the Cherusci and their confederacy Tiberius conducted at
least one campaign (764, nu. ιι), in which he is stated to have spent
some time across, but not far from the Rhine ², and is credited with much
the same acts of general devastation⁸ as are recorded of Germanicus.
One expression (‘ aperit limites ') would point to some more permanent
result, probably to the reoccupation of the outpost of Aliso ⁴, and the
restoration of 'its communications with Vetera by a barricaded road along
the Lippe ⁸.

Germanicus, on succeeding to the command, took no offensive aetion
during his first year, and seems to have planned none for his second;

being represented as intended only to restore the morale of the troops
after the mutiny ⁶. Possibly he was encouraged by its success and
Roman opinion generally by an exaggerated report of it ⁷, to look upon
reconquest as feasible; possibly 'liberius himself was inclined to a more
vigorous ellort to recover ground that he had done so much to irin, than
the old age and infirmity of angustus had been willing to sanction:
anyhow‚ the next two years show a really energetic attempt to regain the
frontier of the Elbe. Tacitus helps us little to conceive the plan of

campaign; but here, as elsewhere ⁸, some detail casually mentioned often
helps us to see a meaning in what seemed purposeless; and we shall

hardly be wrong in thinking that the first object was to weaken the
confederacy in detail by bringing an overwhelming force to bear on its
chief outlying members before the centre was assailed. From this view
the already mentioned onslaught on the Marsi, who lrad been so
prominent as to have captured an engle ³, may be part of a scheme.

The chief campaign of 7⁶8, no. 15, is, as we read it, an enigma
