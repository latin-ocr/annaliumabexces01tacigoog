142 IN TRODUC TION. [cass. vill.

He is told that ‘the laws are to be enforced,’ and an immediato crop of
charges is the result. The whole of the rufe of Tiberius is thus an
exceptional period of the activity of this law, immediately afterwards
professedly suspended by Gaius, and really so from the accession of
Claudius, till it was revived, as a potent engine of tyranny, in the eighth
year of Nero¹. it should be further mentioned that the atrict legal
penalty is a severe form of exile, and that all indiction of death under
this law is an excess’.

During this first period, about twelve tn'ais' may be noted, in which
this is either the sole charge, or more frequently coupled with others ⁴.
ln two cases acts are alleged, which in any age would have been treason·
able ⁶, if proved; in the others the charge is grounded either on amore
or less strained interpretation of acts, or, in one or two cases, on words ⁸.
It should be added, that in three cases the charge of ‘maiestas' is dis-
missed before trial'; and that three others result in acquittal⁸3 and
that the one case in which death is indicted for an offence of words takes
piace in the absence of Tiberius, who finds fault with, and takes measures
to prevent in future so precipitare a sentence ⁹.

It may be admitted that the number of cases is not large in itself, aad
that many among this number seem due to the desire of accusem to
secure a conviction by multiplying counts in the indictment, especially by
adding a charge not less sweeping and formidabie than the modern
phrase of ‘conduct calculated to bring the govemment into contempt;'
acharge especially difficult to meet under such a constitution as that of
the Caesars, resting on innumerable vagae lines and fictions. We may
also admit that Tiberius, though with frequent vacillations of purpose ¹⁰,
shows on the whole at present no disposition to press for convictione, or
for extreme sentences upon conviction. On the other band, even a small
