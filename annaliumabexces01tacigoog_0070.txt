Cur. vt] THE SYNTAX AND STYLE OF TACITUS. 53

Nipp. (on 2. 59) gives a somewhat different classihcation ol these
usages. See also Platner, as quoted on § 22 b.

Ill. Verbs.

38. (a) Veris os speaking or thinking ore omitted more srnly than by
(hirriat writers (see Madv. 479), when the language clearly shows itselt
to be that ol a speech, or when the thought or speech has been indicated
in the context: as ι. 9, 4; 38, 3; a. 5, 3, trc.; also especially in lively
descriptione, as 1. 41, 2 ; ι4. 7, 2, irc. Dr. § 34, Nipp. on r. 9, Gud. on
Dial. ιο, 33, Roby ¹441·

description or rhetorical passages, as in t. 43, 1 ; 4. 38, 5; ι4. 8, 4, irc. '

Verbs ol moving are frequently omitted in Cicero’s letters, but suth
ellipses are rare in historical narrative. Dr. § 35, Nipp. on 4. 57.

ln several instances belonging to (o) or (t), the reading is questioned.
See notes on 4. ι2, 6; 57, 1, 14. 61, 3. irc.

39. Some omissione os parts ty the vert ‘esse' are characteristic ol
Tacitus by their trequency. Dr. 6 36. For the general rules, see Roby
ι442-ι444. (In several places, some editors insert tlte verb.)

(o) In ttre indicative, the omissioh ol ‘erat’ ‘erant' &c., as ι. 34, ι;
2. 6, 2 ; 3. 65, 2 ; 6. 35, at dcc. (rare in Cicero, more common in Sallust
and Livy, still more in Vergil), especially the omission in relaive or
dependent clauses, as itt cuius manu ι. 7, 9; and with ubi 2. 83, 3
(Sallust); donec 4. 74, 6 ; ut quis t. 69, 2, tte. See wotfflin (Bursian's
Jahresberichte, iii. 759).

tt. 35, 2 ; ι5, 49, ι) in the perhtense (Gud'. on Dial. 18, 12). Alew

. atatt times. See Nipp. on 1. 7 ; Her. on H. t. 21, to.

(c) In the rirfim'tizu, the omission ol ‘lore’ as in 2. 15, 3, and ol
‘tuisse' with participles, as in a.3t, 4; 73,4; 3. 16, t; 17, r, 22, 6,
hc, when the context makes it plain what tense is meant. A lew
instances occur in Sallust and Livy. All these ellipses ol verbs are

treated very sully by G. Clemm (see on ξ 80).

40. 'l'ho poenieat nso of simplo verbs fot· componun, occasional
in earlier prose, is rare in the minor worlts, not common in the llistori‘es,
