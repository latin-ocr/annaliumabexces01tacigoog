These two periods, comprising together eight years and a quarter,
782-790, nn. 29-37, may be taken together, and must in great part be
studied without the aid of Tacitus

The Fiith Book opens with the death of Augusta, wh0, aster having
been charged, by hints more or less explicit, with every death in the
house of the Caesars, is now represented no longer as the ‘terrible step-
mother,' butas the sole remaining protection of the family supposed to
have been most obnoxious to her ¹. ln another place such discrepancies
are loosely accommodated by saying that she ostentatiously supported in
adversity those whom she had secretly undennined in their prosperity’.
The verdict of historical criticism has generally acquitted her of these
imputations, and regarded her, throughout the long and unbroken period
of her ascendeney, as a softening and moderating influence on her
husband and her son. And indeed, whatever her personal feeling
towards the house of Germanicus, we may suppose ber sufficiently
imbued with the policy of Augustus ⁸, to see that her son had far more
to gain than tolose by surrounding himself with family support; and that
it would not be desirable for him at the age of seventy to be left with no
heir but his grandson Tiberius Gemellus, aboy of ten years old ⁴.

Her overpowe‘ring influente, even to the close of life, is pictured in
the description ol Tiberius and Seianus ‘breaking loose‚ as if freed from
bit and bridle ⁶,' and hastily despatching to the senate the charges already
drawn up, but kept back by her intercession, against Agrippina and
Nero. The former is accused ol arrogant langunge, the latter of pro· ·
fligaey, a charge which the general vicious propensities of this family
render only too probable, but which we must suppose to have been
seized as a handle of attack in default of other charges. Itis expressly
asserted that no act of treason was alleged against either, and we infer
that no evidence oi such could have been forthcoming ⁸. The character·
istic irresolution of the rescript left the senate perplexed, and even
a second more peremptory mandate still reserved the sentence to be
passed ¹. With precautions against rescue which attest their popularity',
