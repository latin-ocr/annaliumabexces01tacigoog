PREFACE ΤΟ THE SECOND EDITION. lx

assisted me Ι must make special mention of ΜΓ. F.
Haverfield, who has called my attention to many points ,
requiring reconsideration, and has directed me to many
inscriptions and special treatises os which Ι should other·
wise have been ignorant.

Thanlrs to such aid, it will, 1 hope, be found that this
edition, whatever its present demerita shows a consider·
able advance on the former, both as regards the cor·
rection os errors, and the recognition oi later means of
information. ln the Introduction, especially, large por· Ι
tions have been altogether re·written, and the whole
caresully revised, and sew pages oi the notes are without
more or less important additions and alterations; while
the amount of minor errors to be removed has proved
to be lar beyond what my critics had noted or I had
myseli expected to find.

Under these circumstances the size os the volume has
been perhaps unfortunately increased; and some apology
seems due sor an addition os about fifty pages to an
amount os commentary which many may have already
thought excessive. It was, however, hardly possible to
bring the book up to date without some increase in bulk;
and 1 may say that the new matter would have consider·
ably exceeded the amount mentioned is it had not been
compensated by omissions and curtailments wherever it
seemed possible to make such without loss os useiulness.

To any who have carried their studies deeply into the
vast array os literature on Tacitus enumerated in the
‘Bibliotheca Scriptorum Classicorum ’ ol Engelmann and
Preuss (8th ed, Leipzig, 1882) ¹, such a list os works

¹ Nearly forty pages, most oi thern and the list ot‘ separate trentises on special
closely printed in small type, are taken subjects or questions. Several pages more
up with enumerations ol editions or trans- would be required to complete the cata·
latiens of the whole or parts ol Tacitus, logne to the present date.
