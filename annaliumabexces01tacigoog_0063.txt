46 INTRODUCTION. “ [curav.

'erat 1.59, 1. Dr. § 48. The ordinary usage whereby‚ in expressions
such as cui nomen est, the name itsell is attracted to the case ol the
pronoun‚ is restricted by Tacitus to adjectives <as 1. 3ι, 6, a: 8, ι, decl:
the nominative (ae ι. 45, 1‚&c.)‚or, rarely‚ the genitive (see note on
4. 59, 6), being used ol substantives. (Nipp. on 6. ι6.) Cp. Madv. 646,
Obs. 6. 3.

17. 'l'lte ‘dativus commodi’ is extended to such usages as sibi
...procubuisse 1. 59, 4; sibi . . . firmabat ι. 7ι, 5; ut mihi insomnis, sic
tibi magnifica ι6. 37, 6 ; perhaps non referre dedecori 15· 65, 6.

18. 'Phe dative of the egent or subjective dative is used, without
restrictiori to the gerundive orto passive participles or adjectives in
‘bilis' (Roby ιι46), and without any notion ol the interest ol the agent
(Madv. 656 a), in more than thirty places, e. g. sibi . . . adspici 1. ι7, ιο ;
propinquis...removeretur 6. 5ο, 4. Cp. 6. 57, 5; 3. 3, 3; ao, 3, tec.
It is not easy always to distinguish this dative from such ablativee as are
noted in§27. Dr.§5r, Nipp. on 6. 5ο, Her. on H. ι.ιι, 8, Gud. on
Dial. 4, 8.

19. 'Phe detinente noun eo closely connected vvith another
thet a genitive would be expected (Roby 1154), frequent in poets, is
also frequent in Livy. and still more in Tacitus; e. g. rector iuveni ι, 64, 3;
paci firmator 6. 46, 6, and very many others. Dr. ξ 53.

20. 'Phe dative of the thing es object, osten used with adjectives
or participles, as promptus r. 6, 1‚&c.; intentus ι. 3ι, 6; facitis 6. 67, 6,
&c.; appears to be an extensiones the usage with persons. See Nipp.
on ιι. 6ι, Madv. 647.

21. 'Phe dative efter compound verbs, where· accus. with prep.
would be usual, is also poetical, as pectori adcreverat 1. 69, ι (where
see note); penatibus induxerit 5. 1, 3, dcc.

22. Detive ol work contempleted. Roby ιι56, ι386.

(α) Gemnd. Such expressione as restaurando sufficeret 3. 76, 4;
testificando vulgabat ι3. ιι, 6 (cp. 15· ι6, 6); appear to be exten·

sions ol the classical phrases solvendo esse, scribendo adesse. Dr.
§ 666 Α.

(6) Gemndive. It is characteristic ol Tacitus to employ this usage
with increasing, and latterly with great frequency: only three instances
being found in the minor works, and thirteen in the Histories, while it
abounds in the Annals more than in any other Latin author. 1t is

used with more than twenty adjectivee (sec r. 63, 57 37, r; 6, 57, 3, .
