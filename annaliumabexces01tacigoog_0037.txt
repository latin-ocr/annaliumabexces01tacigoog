have had access to them. It is stated that Gaius bumt at his accession
an important part of the journals of Tiberius, containing the record
of the condemnation of Agrippina and her sons, and made solemn
profession that he had never read them ¹. However this may be,
other journals of this prince are said elsewhere to have ‚been preserved,
and to have formed the favourite study of Domitian ¹.

5. Public Inscriptions. It is needless to spealt of the multitude which
must have been at the time in existence, or of their manifold value to
historians. Tiberius is stated to have talten great pains early in his
principate to preserve and restore ancient documents ⁸. We have, how·
ever, no evidence that Tacitus was in the habit of consulting inscriptions,
though he makes mention of decrees so recorded⁴, and once refers to
such evidence of the letters added to the alphabet by Claudius ⁸.

6. Pamphlet literature, chiefly satirical. Probably, in spite of repres-
sion, tltis existed in considerable amount⁸, and may have been the
ultimate source of much that we find in Suetonius. .

7. Tratlition. The lifetime of Tacitus was not so far removed from
the days of even Tiberius, but that many traditional anecdotes were
still current. He statesa report of this ltind, for what itis worth, in
his account of the trial of Cn. Piso⁷; he mentions, in order to refute
it, an idle talc respecting the death of Drusus, son of Tiberius⁸; he
seems to refer to oral testimony of living persons on the reality of the
Pisonian conspiracy ⁹, and elsewhere contrasts ‘fama' with ‘auctores ¹⁰,'
and some of his vague expressions, such as ‘traditur,' ‘ferunt' ‘memoriae
proditur,' may in some cases designate such floating stories.

lt will thus be seen that as far as the mere amount of material is
concerned, the resources at the command of Tacitus were as ample as
are found at most periods of ancient history.

hluch, however, of this abundant material must have been untrust·
worthy. The first fundamental defect to notice is that which has been
prominently put forward by Dio, at the transition point in his narrative ¹¹.
