cmvii] ROME UNDER AUGUSTUS AND TIBERIUS. 103

under the title of ‘equites inlustres‘ or other similar names¹; men of
senatorial census, or even among the wealthiest in the state ', who
remained within the equestrian rank from choice. Of these the most
famous was Maecenas, and those who filled similar positions in imperial
confidence after him, as Sallustius Crispus⁸ and Seianus, and many
others who by filling such offices as the important ‘praefecturae’ in
Rome· and that of Egypt⁵ held a position superior to most senators ⁸.
The equestrian order was thus a gainer by the revolution, both through
the relative depression of the order above them, and through the special
career of emolument and distinction held out to thern. Throughout
the empire, the ‘societates' of persons qualified for this rank farmed the
revenue', and the residence of their superiore at Rome left thern the
aristocracy of municipal Italy and the provinces, and many might pass
from the lower to the higher rank of their order by the emperor's favour.
The gift of this higher rank, that of ‘Eques Romanus' in the proper
sense, tenable for life, and always ltept by the princeps in his own hands,
opened a public career of continually increasing dignity and importance‚
starting with officerships in the army ⁸, and leading up, through one civil
appoinunent after another, to what were in fact the most influential posts
in the state ·. Thus had the emperors set up beside the old hereditary
senatorial nobility a personal nobility of their own creation‚ and turned
to their advantage and the public service the long-standing rivalry of the
orders ¹⁰.

The resident senators and lmights with their wives aud children, and
many of the families of those absent on foreign service, formed an upper
population in Rome, variously estimated at from 10,ooo to nearly 5o,ooo ¹¹.
To these wealthy classes belonged most of the ‘domus' or palaces¹¹,
filling, with their gardens and grounds, so large a portion of the city3
which, with the great addition made by Augustus to the public buildings
