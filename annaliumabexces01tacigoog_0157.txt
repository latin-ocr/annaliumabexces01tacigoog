it we suppose his natural irresolution to have mingled with his disguise,
he would not be the only one whose seli-reliance had failed him at the
crisis oi his fortunes: andos the reasons given ior his conduct, two at
least are thoroughly substantial. As regards the armies, he certainly did
‘hold a wolf by the ears ¹,' whether he was aware'oi the actual mutiny or
not: and the constitution oi the principate, as well as the absence at this
date oi any monarchical or dynastic tradition ¹, required him to secure his
position by laying all stress on the apparent free choice oi the senate ¹.
Another leading instance is sought in his whole conduct to Germanicus ⁴,
which again, even in its most questionable points, shows habitual irresolu-
tion rather than malice. The position in which Germanicus is found
at the death oi Augustus· is strengthened rather than impaired⁸; he is
allowed to levy war in such mode and on such scale as he pleases; his
distinctions are more than equal to his deserts²3 his recall, as has been said
above ⁸, is justihable. Yet it is but natural that the compulsoryadoption’
should rankle in a mind so disposed to brood on its grievances ¹⁰: and,
side by side with the confidence which Tiberius selt when great armies
were under his sons ¹¹, might turk some distrust os the young man's po-
pularity, and oi the masculine energy of his wiie¹'. Thus we discem
amotive ior sending him to the East, where the legions did not ltnow
him, and ior replacing a legate so connected with him as Creticus Silanus ¹⁸
hy one who could be trusted at least to hold his own. Cn. Piso, again,
was much to be mistrusted. The proudest member ol one oi the noblest
houses yet leit ¹⁴, he had spoken out in the senate ¹⁸, and had perhaps been
noted by Augustus as dangerous ¹⁸. Yet his wile stood high in the favour
oi Augusta¹³, and he could hardly be passed over in the siward ol pro·
uinces. lt is reasonable to suppose that the one mistrust was set against
the other, that he was to be some check on his young ‘imperator ¹⁸,' who,
in turn, was to checlr him hyan ‘imperium ntaius' on the spot ¹⁹. Such
