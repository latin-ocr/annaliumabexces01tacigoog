interposing to modily the proposed penalty ol death or stricter banish·
ment ¹, satisfied apparently with the convictlon itsell.

Lastly, at the close ol this period, in the case ol Titius Sabinus we are
informed oi disgracelul expedients to procure evidence ¹, ol a hurried
vote and immediate execution without trial, on the very opening festival
os the new year, in obedience to a missive from the prince⁸. There may
have been more in the case than is reported ⁴, but the ominous beginning
ol the terrible letters lrom Capreae must be noted here.

Inlormers again appear to be more openly encouraged, sometimes
protected from just retribution in case oi ialsehood ⁸, and secured oi their
reward, even where condemnation was anticipated by suicide ⁸. Conhsoe·
tions also now begin to appear, and sofar bear out the imputation that
an appetite lor thern has arisenl.

Yet the candour oi Tacitus shows much os the better and greater side
ol the character still remaining in the dignihetl address on the death oi
Drusus ⁸, energy in public business ⁹, prompt investigation ol a crime¹⁰,
strict repression ol a popular seandal¹¹, resolute disdain os extravagant
honours ¹², munificence on occasion ol a public disaster ¹⁸. Much again ol
mere gratuitous insinuation may yet be cast aside: such as that hewse
jealous os honour pald to young Nero and Drusus ¹⁴ ; attended to public
business only to disarm suspicion¹⁶; refused a temple srom mere mean·
spiritedness ι“; suppressed mention os military disasters because he dared
trust no one to levy war¹'; and the like. The memoirs ol the younger
Agrippina are once at least¹⁸, and probably more than once ¹⁹, laid under
contribution, with other matter which must be received with much reserve²⁰.

Still, alter all deductions made, there seems to be evidence that,
besides the increased sensitiveness to attack, already noticed, a change
is growing upon him, a consciousness ol iailing powersn, in which even
the oller to resign may have been half-sincere”, a growing dread oi
conspiracies and ol those in whose interest they might be supposed to
take place; whereby the house ol Germanicus, still in favour at the
beginning ol this period ²³, are on the brinlt ol destruction at its close 2⁴.
How iar their conduct justified, or could be made to appear to justif ,
such estrangement, can be never known ²⁶. We can see that their position
