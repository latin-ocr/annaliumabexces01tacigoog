108 INTRODUCTION. [ensa. vlt.

Augustus had also given the peninsula its first organisation as a whole,
by mapping it out into the eleven regions recorded by Pliny¹; an
arrangement which, though probably intended only to facilitate a census,
became the permanent basis of its administration, which in other respecta
appears to have undergone little change till the second century a.u.'.

The probable population of ltaly at this time can be barely guessed
αι’ ; but there is abundant evidence that the free rustic people‚ rapidly
diminishing as early as the time of the Gracchi ⁴, and further thinned by
civil wars, had sunk far below the number that could have been employed
or supported; probably even below the δεινὴ demmin? of the time of'
the dictator Caesar. Strabo attests the depopulation of southern ltaly‘:
Livy is no less explicit on that of the oentral districts, and is arnnned that
the country which once sent forth the Aequian and Volscian armies could
now barely recruit the household troops of Rome, and would be a desert,
but for the slave-gangs': the most eloquent words ascribed by Tacitus

to Tiberius dwell on the scanty produce of a soil that cannot have been
cultivated to its best ⁸. Pliny traces tbe evil to the ‘latifundia' which
had extinguished all careful and energetic husbandry'3 the words of
Tiberius point scornfully to the tracte made wholly unprotluctive by the
noble mansione with their parles and pleasure grounds ¹⁰. Probably the

rich and fertile Transpadane district, less devastated by civil war, and
apparently more free from the curse of the chained slave-gange ¹¹, may
have formed a contrast to the general state of the peninsula, in which the
huge city, and many flourishing towns ¹², must have made the desolation
of other towns and of the rural districts only more evident

Love of country life, with its frugal simplicity and healthy habits, is
undoubtedly genuine in Horace; and the ideal of such a life, or of that
ofa retired Italian town, is professedly admired by many a Roman who
knew as little of it aa the money-lender hinne, or who had little real
intention to take refuge at Cumae with Umbricius ¹⁴, or to change the
