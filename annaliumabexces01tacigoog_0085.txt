the instances are trivial (see the so·called hexameters in 3. 44, 4; ι5.
9, ι; 73, 4; Agr. ιο, 4); one only is noteworthy lor its rhythm

Ι (angrariis patrum et prisca tormidine sacrum G. 39, ι), and one other

ior its position, as forming a complete period. and as the opening
sentence oi the Annals. The hexameter with which Livy begins is,
as lar as it goes, much more rhythmical and he has many rnore such
verses or parts oi verses than Tacitus. No more can be proved, than
that the ear ol neither ol these historiens was so sensitive in avoidance
ol such cadences, as tirat ol Cicero (see de Orat. 3. 47, 18a; Orat. 56,
ι89) οι Quintilian (see 9. 4, ιι).

80. turpem, aud similer abbreviated expressione. By iar the
most important ol these are found in syntectical usages already noticed,
ina large proportion oi which the desire ol brevity ol expression appears
prominent; especially in the omission oi pronouns (ξ 8), oi verbs ((9 38,
39), ol prepositions (see references on 9 56), and other particles (ξ) 64,
65); in the fondness lor concise constructions with the infinitis-e (9) 4ο,
43, 44, 46), with gerunrl and gerundive (99 aa, 36, 33), with in and the
accusative (5 6ο b). with nisi and ni (9 5ο). Α lew other ellipses are
noted by Dr. 9 238, such as omissions ol pars (4. 20, 3), annus (ιι. ιι,
ι), dies (4. 45, 4), lex (3. ι5, ι), uxor (4. ιι, 4), filia (rr. 1, 3), &c.;
many ol which would be oqmmon in arry approach to colloquial lorrns,
asin comic poets and in the letters oi Cicero, as well as in inscriptions

quentiae Taciteae quibusdam generibus,' Leipzig, 1881.

st. aususausus use ol participial clauses tends to conciseness
(see 9( 3ι, 54, 55), and is characteristic ol Tacitus; as is illustrated by the
comparison made by Draeger (9 238) between simple narrative passages
ol the same length, in Caes. B. G. a. 1-2 ; Sall. Jug. 6-73 Liv. ar. 53
and Ann. 2. rr·1a; in which, respectively, the participial clauses are 5,
ιο, ι6, and ι4. lnstances oi such participial and also ol adjectival
clauses are given by Nipp. on 3. 55; 4. 64.

82. Perentheses. Besides the explanatory accusative already noticed
(ξ ra α), Tacitus frequently has a parenthetical word or expression in
apposition in the nominative, equivalent to a complete relative clause; as
vix credibile dictu 1. 35, 6 ; mirum dictu a. ιι, 4; incertum is thur
used by Livy, &c.; dubium by Ovid, &c.; rarum by Tacitus aione, and
chieily in the Annals, 1. 39, 7; 56, a; 6. ιο,3; 13.a,2; also H. 4.
ιι, 3. For more complete parenthetical sentences, see 4. 55, 6; ιι.
