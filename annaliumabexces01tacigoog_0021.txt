The reign of terror during the last three years 'of Domitian, from 846
to 849, nn. 93 ιο 96, he appears to describe as an eye-witness '.

Hitherto he must have been acceptable to the princes under whom
he had lived¹; and even in these last years he appears, by his own
confession, ιο have shown no more courage or independence than the
rest of the senate, with whom, in his scil-reproach, he identifies himself ’;
but the lasting influence on his mind of the memory of this period will
be found traceable in all his writings, and strengthened, rather tlran
wealrcned, by the force of time⁴. lt is hardly to be wondered at, that
one who had lived through such scenes should be haunted through life by
the spectre of Domitian.

ln 850 or 851, nn. 97 or 98, he attained consular ranlr, as ‘suffectus'
and in that capacity delivered the funeral eulogy on L. Verginius Rufus,
the famous legatus of Upper Germany of mn. 68 ⁵.

In 853, nn. roo, he tras associated with Pliny in the pmsecution,
more successful in apparent than in substantial results, of illarius Priscus,
proconsul of Africa‘. lt is on this occasion only that any particular
cause pleaded by the great orator is recorded, or the grave dignity of his
oratory especially mentioned ⁷.

Our only further knowledge of his personal history is given by
arecently discovered inscription showing him to have been proconsul of
Asia ⁸. The date, which is not given, would he in the usual course some
twelve or fourteen or possibly sixteen years after that of the consulship,
