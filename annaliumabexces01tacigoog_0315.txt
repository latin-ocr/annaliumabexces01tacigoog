’1. Sed Caesar, dum adiguntur naves, Silium legatum cum
expedita manu inruptionem in Chattos lacere iubet: ipse audito
castellum Lupiae flumini adpositum obsideri, sex legiones eo
duxit. neque Silio ob subitos imbres aliud actum quam uta

sinodicam praedam et Arpi principis Chattorum coniugem filiam-

famam adventus eius dilapsi: tumulum tamen nuper Varianisa
