in case ol a sudden vacancy; but who, altera sacrifice oi the best years
ol his lite lor the ruling house, might expect to be summarily set aside
sor a youth, it circumstances hercat'ter made it seasible. Such in the
earlier years was Agrippa, and such was in later times the position ol
Tiberius. Each was victim in turn to the matrimonial arrangements
which Augustus always carried out with more than a Roman's disregard
oi natural affection, often witha cynical contempt even sor common
‹lecency ¹. Each had endeavoured to escape lrom an intolerable position
by retirement from Rome '. Agrippa, had he lived long enough, would
probably again have had to retire before his own sons, adopted into the
family of the Caesars over his head. Tiberius, even at the death ol Gaius,
had Germanicus been ten years older or Augustus ten years younger,
would probably have been again postponed to the grandson ol Octavia,
whose children by Agrippina would still more nearly represent the true'
blood ol Augustus '.

We may well believe that a sense ol public⁴ duty cooperated with the
solicitations ol Livia, in procuring the adoption ol her son, which she so
osten recalled to him in alter times 11 the crowning service oi her 11111.
Still, with the tenacity that marked 111 his policy, Augustus seemed even
then to leaves chance open lor luture family schemes, not only by him-
sell adopting at the same time the worthless Agrippa Postumus ⁸, but
also by compelling Tiberius, as the price of his own adoption, to adopt
Germanicus ², and thus ιο prejudice the position of his sou by blood,
Drusus, who was a year or two younger. Even the prospectos a possible
civil war could not turn the old man {roma scheme which might one

Germanicus and his house, and the suspicions, not the less real because
