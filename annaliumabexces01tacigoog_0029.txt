derived frorn any other literature known ιο us ; all are confirmed by coins
or inscriptions of which Bracciolini and his contemporaries must have
been ignorant '.

lt secnw hardly worth while to pursue this subject further. lf it is
thus clear that the ‘Annals’ must have been written in ancient times,
when sources of information now lost to us were in existence, and are
likely to have been written before the date of Ptolemy, we are entitled ιο
quote the testimony of Jerome, that Tacitus did write, in thirty Books,
the history of the whole period, or, as he expresses it, ‘the lives'of the
Caesnrs,' from the death of Augustus to that of Domitian⁸; an arrange·
ment of books answering to that of the second Medicean MS, which
contains material purporting ιο be transcribed from an original of the
date nn. 395, or contemporary with Jerome ⁴. Also on this view the
resemblances in Sulpicius Severus ⁸, Ammianus ⁶, and other writers will
rank as copies not as originals, and such knowledge of these Books as
is shown in the Middle Ages becomes relevant ², especially the grounds for
thinking that a MS. answering generally in contents to the second llfedicean
was known to Boccaci0, who died before the birth of Bracciofini ⁸.
