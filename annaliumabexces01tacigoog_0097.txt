80 INTRODUCTION. [cmv. t't.

‘consulare imperium ¹,’ censorial power being, in the theory ol the con·
stitution, inherent in the consular, before the existence of the censorship
as a separate ollioe. lt is inferred, both from what he says and from
what lte appears to imply, that this 'consulare imperium' was used for
this purpose only, and that no general or permanent consular power was
ever assumed ¹.

During the remainder of this principate the chief points ιο notice are
the successive quinquennial or decennial renewals of the ‘imperium⁸;'
the assumption, on tbe death of Lepidus in 742, nc. ra, of the office
of ‘ pontifex maximus‘‚' always henceforth held by the princeps until in
the fourth century it came ιο he refused by Christian emperors and
passed to the bishops of Rome⁸3 and the formal acceptance, on universal
acclamation, of the title ‘Pater Patriae' in 752, nc. τ’.

The following inscription gives his tides nearly at the close of his life:
‘Imp Caesar, Diri 1², Augustus, Pontif. Maxim, Cos. xiii, lmp. sx,
Tribunic. Potestat. xxxiii, P.P.⁷'

The first succession to the principale must have been modilied hythe
fact that the successor was alreadv ‘collega imperii,' and had the tri·

. bunieian power l, and afterwards numbered his years of this oflice

without recognizing any change at the death of Augustus. lle also
dropped the fiction ol periodical renewal of imperium, though a decen·
nial festival was held '. He must haveat least received by decree the
title of ‘ Augustus' which, though he affected some reserve in its use¹⁰,
appears on all his coins and inscriptions ; but he never allowed himself
to be called ‘pater patriae ¹¹! lt is also noteworthy that neither Tiberius.
Gaius, nor Claudius, uses the ‘praenomen imperatoris ¹'.' The tides
borne by Τ iberius at the close of his life are seen from an inscription
quoted elsewhere ¹⁸.

Gaius appears, from the account of Dio, to have been the first to
receive all the powers of the principate by a single decree ¹⁴3 while
