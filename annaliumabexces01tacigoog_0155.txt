in the first three Boolts‚ and reviewed at the beginning of the Fourth is
at once that bn which his information is most full, and his estimate most
questionable: the whole time being thus summarily dismissed, not as that
in which the purpose was most sineere, but in which the disguise was best
sustained.

The fact of generally just and moderate government is admitted and
indisputable. We are told ol constant consultation of the senate, even
on matters not strictly belonging to their cognizance¹; and its chief
members are encouraged to discuss, and rebuked for servility² ; that the
office of the magistrates of the republic is respected⁸; the laws, with one
exception ⁶, uprightly administered ; thatin the bestowal of dignities the
worthiest were selected; that Tiberius set an example of frugality, both
in the moderate siae and number of his Italian estates, amid the vast villas
of the nobles ⁵, and in unostentatious management and retinue3 as well
as an example of moderatiori in conducting disputes with other citizens
as between equals in the law-courts. Itis further admitted that these
characteristics at home were accompanied by clemency and vigilance
abroad: that no new burdens were laid on the provinces ; the old ones
adjusted with care and remitted on occasion; personal ,violence and
confiscation scrupulously avoided; crnelty and extortion in govemors
duly punished; fiscal procuratorships conferred on men of character,
even without personal ltnotvledge5 and their tenure indefinitely emended,
as if to diminish temptation to peculation‚ by giving men time to grow
rich without it.

Many even of what secmed to Tacitus defects of policy, would be
merits to an impartial critic ; who, for instance, would hardly be induced
to believe that Germanicus, whose chief recorded achievements are those
of mere ravage and massacre ⁸, or ostentatious and futile obsequies to the
remains of those who fell with Varus ², or at best barren victories in the
field ', balanced by disastrous retreats⁸, and entailing untold requisitions
on Gaul ¹⁰, was recalled from an all but completed conquest ¹¹.

The general foreign policy of sucha ruler naturally finds little favour
with an historiari who looked baclt with fondness to the military glories of
the old Republic¹’, and was writing when the star of conquest was again
in the ascendent, when the eagles had advanced to the Carpathians and
· the Pruth, and beyond the Euphrates and Tigris, the fleet to the Persian
Gulf and the Indian Ocean. His disdain 'is natural for theold ‘narrow
