168 INTRODUCTION.

8. Α (9)- The date os Agrippina’s death is given in 6. 25, 5. The dates
oi her birth and marriage, and those ol the birth ol her children, are
given as determined by Mommsen (Hermes, xiii. 145-365) Her
mortuary inscription is preserved (C. I. L. vi 886, Rushlortb 54).

9. A (1ο). Agrippa Postumus was adopted by Augustus at the same
nme with Tiberius in 757, nn. 43 and is styled ‘Agrippa Caesar' in
inscriptions (C. 1. L. 11. 465, Henzen 5378), and on a medal struck at
Corinth, which gives also his effigy (Cohen, i. p. 187). He was removed
to Surrentum (Suet. Aug. 65) about 766, nn. 7, and thence to Planasia.
On his death, see 1. 6.

10. A (ra). lt is generally supposed that the Silanus to whom Aemilia
Lepida was married was the consul oi 772, nn. 19, on whom see note

on a. 59, 1. Pliny records (Ν. H. 7. 13,11, 51) that their eldest son, '

Μ. Silanus (on whom see note on 13. 1, 1), was born in the last year
oi Augustus, who had thus lived to see his great-great·grandson. For
L. Silanus (ao), see notes on ra. 3, a ; for D. Silanus (ar), see on ra.
58, 17 lor Junia Calvina (aa), see on ra. 4, r; lor Junla Lepida (13),
see on 16. 8, a. L. Silanus (25) (on whom see 15. 51, 3 ; 16. 7, a),
who, like his uncle (ar), bore the name oi Torquatus (on which see 3.
69, 9), appears to have been the last oi this lamily, and, except the
emperor Nero, the last surviving male descendant ol Augustus.

11. A (13). Nero Caesar was born probably in the middle ol 759, nn.
6 (see Henzen, p. 6ο), and was betrothed in childhood to a daughter ol
Creticus Silanus (a. 43, 3), and married to Julia in 773, nn. ao, on his
entry into public lile (3. 19,4). Tacitus describes his character (4. 15 3 59),
the plots against him (4. 6ο ; 67), and the lormal charges brought against
him (5. 3). 011 these he was banished to Pontia, and subsequently
pronounced a public enemy (Suet. Cal. 7) and put to death or compelled to
suicide (Suet. Tib. 54), shortly besore the lali ol Seianus. His titles were
those oi flamen Augustalis, sodalis Augustalis, sodalis Titius, irater arvalis,
fetialis, quaestor. C. 1. L. vi. 913, Lehmann, Claudius, 95-109.

12. A (14). Drusus Caesar was born probably in the latter part ol 760,
run. 7 (see Henzen, p. 60). His entry into public lile is mentioned in
4. 4, 1; his character in 4. 6ο, 5. He was also denounced as a public
enemy (Suet. Cal. 7), and imprisoned in the Palatium, where he died
(6. a 3, 4). His marriage with Aemilia Lepida was mentioned in the lost
partos Bools v. (see on 6. 4ο, 4), his previous betrothal to a sister oi Otho
in Suet. Oth. 1. His titles are given as follows, praelectus urbi (see 4.
36, 1), sodalis (or flamen) Augustalis (Insc. Orell. 667), aud pontilex3
