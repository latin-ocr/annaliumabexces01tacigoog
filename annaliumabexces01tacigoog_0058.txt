entatu] THE SYNTAX AND STYLE OF TACITUS. 41

the more studiously seek to create variety, and stimulate the flagging
interest of the reader, even by ever so short an episode¹; by a de·
parture from his usual order of narrative²; by multiplying, artificially
and even fancifully, the expressions for constant occurrences³; by
a hundred small variations in the structure or arrangement of sentences⁴3
by straining more and more after noveltie8‚ or by occasionally reviving
archaisms in vocabulary or phrase⁸; by anything to break the weary
sameness of his chronicle of tyranny.

The old criticism, tracing the characteristics of the style of Tacitus
to poetic colouring, and to the study of brevity and of variety ⁸, will be
seen to be well founded, and to be capable of explanation from the
circumstances of his life and nature of his subJect3 and to show the
natural gifts, not unmiaed with the natural deiects, of the most fin'ished
pleader olan age which required above all that its orators should be
urse, brilliant, and striking.

Historioal style was all the more likely to be rhetorical, owing to the
custom of oral recitation. From many instances in which the effect
on the ear seems to be studled, and others in which oral emphasis
would have removed an ambiguity‚ it is not improbable that Tacitus
may bave adopted this general practice.

To these should be added the most truly personal of all his traits
of style, the elevation and dignity (σεμνότης) known to bave characterized
the orator ², and which, in the relation not only of great matters, but
also of what is trivial, or even revolting, appears never to be lost sight of
by the historiari.

The following instances are almost wholly restricted to the AnnalS,
not only on account of the lirnits of the present work, but ¹also because
these are the most truly Tacitean of all the writings of Tacitus; many
uses and expressions, rare or even unknown in his earlier writings, being
in thern frequentanti even habitual⁸.

The arrangement os Draeger‚ whose sections are cited throughout, is
far more elaborate and scicntific than that here given, which has been
simplified for convenience of general reference. lt will be evident that
