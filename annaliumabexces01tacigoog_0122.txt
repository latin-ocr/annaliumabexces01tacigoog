cunum] ROME UNDER AUGUSTUS AND TIBERIUS. 105

many also of the better classes got what they could from the position of
clients of noble houses. On the ‘clientela' under the empire most of
our infonuation is of later date3 hut it would seem even from Horace
that the old ideas¹ and old personal relation of clientship¹ had passed
away, and that already great men had their ostentatious crowds¹ of such
dependents Still Augustas literature kuows nothing of the scramble for
the ‘sportulm’ or the ignominious position of a Trebius at the table of
a Virro.

Side by side with the rapidly diminishing ‘plebs ingenua‘' nas the
suarm of freedmen. Most of these were probably still outside the pale
of the trrbes ⁸, and none had yet the political and social position in which
this class are found a generation later ¹. Eren at this date there are
those whose wealth at least might vie with that of the nobles ¹, and great
numbers must have belonged to professions or callings requiriug high
eduoetion and earning high payment. The remainder probably swelled
the ranks of the client-class. Augustus endeavoured both ιο limit
manumission by enactment and precept ⁸, and also to utilise freedmen in
the service of the state; ln which they formed the butt of the ‘vigiles','
sud were even drafted wholesale into the legions after the catastrophe of
Varus ¹¹ ; while under Tiberius a large number nere deportcd ιο be
made useful or left to perish in Sardinia¹¹‚ and a law was passed to define
the status ofa class of this order ¹¹.

Any numerical estimate of the ‘plebs urbana' with their wives and
families rests almost wholly on guess·work. We cannot tell how many
of the suburban or even nearest rural population may hare helped to
swell tbe numbers of the soo‚ooo recipients of public com under
Augustus ¹⁸, or the a5o,ooo to geopon sharers in his occasional ‘con-
