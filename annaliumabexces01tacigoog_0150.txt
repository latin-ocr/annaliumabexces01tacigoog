the death ol young Marcellus, who was about a year older, removed
the lirst ol his various rivals [τοττι his path ¹. He was praetor in 737,
nc. 17, at the age os twenty-five, and consul in 741, nc. τ 3, at the age
of twenty-nine ⁸.

Side by side with his advancement in civil offices came a succession
ol military commands. nster a‘tirocinium' as military tribune in the
Cantabrian war, he was sentin 734, nc. ao, in his twenty-second year,
with fornes to the East, to give a king to Armenia5 and had the honour
oi bringing back the standards lost with Crassus ⁴. In 732, nc. 15, he
shared with his brother Drusus the more arduous taslr ol subduing the
mountaineers of the Grisons and Tyrol⁸3 a service which probably gave
the youths their ‘nomen imperatorium ⁸? About this time he received in
marriage Vipsania Agrippina, daughter, by a former wife', ol Agrippa,
who now stood next to Augustus as his son-in·law⁸ and his colleague in
the tribunician power '.

Whatcver hopes may have been raised by the unexpected death ol
Agrippa, in 742, nc. ra, at the age ol fifty-oue-which lest only two
boys, aged eight and five ¹⁰, between the stepsons and the succession-
would lade gradually as time went on and the lads grew older; while⁴ the
immediate disastrous consequence to Tiberius was the shadow cast ovcr
his comendo use, by his forced divorce srom Vipsania, to whom he was
deeply attached ¹¹, and his marriage, lor mere dynastic reasons, to julia,
who may have courted him as a lover, but despised him as her husband,
and showed her contempt by her outrageous profligacy¹¹. Almost
immediately after this marriage he was sent to suppress a rising in
Delmatia and Pannonia ¹⁸3 and aiter the death in 745, nc. 9, ol his
brother Drusus, at the head ol whose funeral train he marched on loot in
mid-winter lrorn the Rhine to Rome¹⁴, he prosecuted the war in Gennany ¹⁵3
lor mrccesses in which he was rewarded in 745 and 747, nc. 9, 7, by
triurnphal distinctions ol some Ιιίιιτιω and a second consulship in the
