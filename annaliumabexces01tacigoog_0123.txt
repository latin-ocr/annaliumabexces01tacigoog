data give a result varying irorn rnore than a million to less than 13311
that sum ¹.

Similar uncertainty attende the attempt to estimate the mass 31 public
and private urban slaves. They are generally called a vast multitude¹;
the ‘familia' ο1 Pedanius Secundus alone numbers 4οο1; still the
majority 31 3133 plebs must have had none or next to none, and many
poor knights or senators very lew. A reasonable estimate takes thern at
800,ooo or 900‚ooo‚ who, with perhaps 60‚ooo peregrini, and a garrison
31 333331, rnay make up the million and a hali to two millions os souls
in Rome 1.

To this vast crowd the chief gilt 31 Augustus was a fairly efficient
organisation 31 police. The city was partitioned into iourteen ‘regiones'
each allotted to the charge os one 31 the magistrates 1ο3 the year 1.
Under these were grouped the 265 ‘vici¹,' or quasi-parocbial corpora·
tiana, choosing each their four wardens or ‘vico-magistri ⁸,' whose duties‚
though mainly religious, were also in part constabulary ¹, at least till the
institution in 756, nn. 6, ο1 the ‘vigiles 11,’ who were so distributed that
each cohort‚ rooo strong, bad 3331313 and ward 31 two regions 11, to guard
srorn lire and robbery; both 31 which were still riie enough in crowded
districts, and streets lit only by the poor passenger's lamp-wick, and now
and then by the rich rnan’s torch train 11. Besides the ‘vigiles' the urban
and praetorian guards were in reserve, 11 needed, and the police magis-
tracy, beyond such powers as rernained to aediles and other magistrates 11,
rested with the city praelect 11.

The principate 31 Tiberius seems on the whole to rnarlr the period
when the populace are least considered ¹¹. They take the oath 31 allegiance
at his accession 11, and then seem to retire lrom prominence. They hare
no votes to sell ¹¹, the general tie ο1 clientship had thereby becorne
more unmeaning, and the rabble are not yet the ‘clientela Caesaris!
