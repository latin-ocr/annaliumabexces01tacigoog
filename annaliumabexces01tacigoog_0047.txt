30 INTRODUCTION. [cau. lv.

The latter would imply the agency ol the gods, who are elsewhere
recogniaed as originators ol destiny ¹, and rulers oi man and nature¹,
sometimes as caring at least to punish ¹, ii not to protect ⁴, sometimes as
those who would bless us it our sins permitted them⁸, sometimes as
pursuing their purpose with sublime indiderence to our good deeds
or evil ⁸.

The Epicurean doctrine, that the deity cares sor none oi us, that good

or bad are fortunate or unfortunate as blind chance may guide, is briedy
dismissed in this passage. In an atheistic form it was no doubt un·
acceptabis to Tacitus and to general opinion, though popular enough,
as Pliny has shown ¹, when brought into apparent harmony with religion
by the elastic theology which worshipped Fortune as a goddess⁸ and
reconciled opposites by the apotheosis os a negation.

The Stoic theory, as stated in the same piace, besides repeating the
well-imown doctrine, that the good are never really miserable nor the
wicled happy, reconciles destiny and ireewill by supposing that aiter
man has made his ‘choice oi lise,' its consequences are detennined, not
by planetary iniluences but by natural causatius. Α more extreme, and
apparently more popular theory, to which Tacitus evidently inclines,
would hold that our destiny is liaed from the moment os our birth, and
could be loretold from our horoscope, were we sure oi our interpreter;
but that the true professore are lew, and the art discredited by the
multitude ol quaclrs.

Believing in astrology, he believed atso in prodigies and omens· as
means whereby the future was revealed; but here again he would say
that misinterpretations were rile ¹⁰, and that many prognostications were
only recognized as such aiter the event ¹¹.
