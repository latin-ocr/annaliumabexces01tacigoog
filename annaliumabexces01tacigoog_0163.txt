twenty in stx', we have also an increase in the capionage ol informers
and in the severity ol sentences.

Many distinctions must however be drawn. Serious charges were
brought, and some of them really proved, against Silius¹, Serenus⁸,
Lucilius Capito⁴; and the gratitude ol the cities ol Asia⁸ must be set
against the murmura ol Roman nobles. All would now respect the
indignant protest os Tiberius against leniency to Suillius, convicted ol
selling justice; and the later history ol the manis admitted to have
shown that compassion was undeservedt Nor will any regret the
punishment ol informers l'or false or vexatious charges l. Three again
are acquitted⁸, another saved by indefinite adjoumment’, another par-

⁴ doned amidst genuine applause¹⁰, in another case the gravest part ol

the charge is allowed to drop ¹¹, in another expulsion lrom the senate is
the only penalty ¹¹, in another the sentence is unknown ¹⁸.

Granting however that the numerical list shrinks thus considerably on
investigation, many cases will still remain showing au increased sensitiva·
uess to libels and vindictiveness in punishing them. Charges ol this
kind, il not, in the former case, actually entering into the indictment, help
to bring about the downlall ol Silius ¹⁴ and L. Piso ¹⁸ ; it is for these that
Votienus ia condemned to exile ¹⁸, and that Cassius Severus, an old
offender ¹², has his punishment increased ¹⁸. Bya further stretch, the law
is made to reach Cremutius Cordus lor awork which, according to one
account, was ol old standing and had even been recited helore Augustus ¹⁹,
and lor a mere passage in which the eulogy was awarded to Cassius
which had once been spoken over him by Brutus¹⁰. We are assured
that the whole circumstances os tbe trial lelt the accused no prospectos
escaping condemnation but by suicide.

Sometimes again conviction is alleged to have been ensorced where
prool was wantiug; as in the trial oi old Serenus on charges os con-
spiracy preferred by his sou; charges which were certainly dismissed as
absurd in respect to some ol the persons implicated in them, and on
which the evidence is stated to have altogether broken down ¹¹. Yet
Tiberius ia represented as insisting upon a condemnatory vote, though
