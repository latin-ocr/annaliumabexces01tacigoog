that so cautious a ruler concentrated his attention here, and disregardcd
the Parthian and British projects of his uncle ¹. It is here that we find
his chief achievements‚ balanced it is true by his one disastrous failure.

When the empire carne into his hands Rome had not full necess even
to the Alpine passes; on the southern slopes of which were still
mountain tribes who plundered the Transpadana ², and when pressed fell
back on their brethren on the northern side: in the Greek peninsula the
Romans were hardly masters of the Balkan (Haemus) and had little
rnore of Illyricum than the borders of the Adriatic ⁸.

It is impossible here to tracc the steps by which, mainly through the
instrumentality of his trusted friend and son-in·law Agrippa, and os his
stepsous Tiberius and Drusus, this state of things resulted in a succession
of new provinces, Vindelicia and Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia, Moesia,
all resting on the natural frontier of the Danube, now for the first time,
and almost for its whole course, made a Roman river.

Westward, the airn proposed, and with some exaggeration claimed as
realised, was the establishment of an ocean frontier from Cadiz to the
mouth of the Elbet The main portion of this was completed by
Agrippa's slow subjugation of Spain ’, and it is undoubtedly true that for
twenty years a province of Germany from the Rhine to the Elbe was in
existence, which, notwithstanding the disaster of Varus, Augustus still
affects to regard as ‘de iure' Roman soil. Even after its abandonmcnt,
it is the military rather than the political frontier which recedes to the
Rhine ⁸, and considerable territories on its right bank still are Roman'3
and it is possible that the debateable land⁸ called the ‘agri decumatcs,'
afterwards enclosed in the well-known ‘limes' connecting the Rhine and
the Danube, may have begun at an early date to be occupied by Gauls
under some sort of Roman protection ⁹.

Upon the conquesta followed a great work of organisation and
settlement, which can bc only briefly glanced at The great roads
of Italy, themselves thoroughly restored and extended ¹⁰, are connected
