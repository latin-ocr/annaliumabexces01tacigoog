resources of Rome to sacca crisis which, with some apparent sorgetlulness
oi the Teutons and the Cimbri, is called the gravest since the Punic
vars ¹. By the time that rhis was quelled all had been lost in Germany
hythe annihilation oi 'rhe army oi Varus in 762, nn. 9²* ; and nothing
remained but to exact vengeance and secure the frontier. The schemes
oi German conquest would seem to have been less nearly executcd, or
their sensibility more misconoeived, than our authorities admit to us; but
the restoration oi order within the empire at least was complete and
permanent, and the triumph of Tiberius in 765, an. rs, well earncd³.
Nor is there reason to doubt the most distinguishing rrait oi his general-
ship, his carelulness ol' his soldiers' lives ⁴, a duty more than ever incumbent
on a general who knew that almost rhe last reserue of Rome was in the
fierda Rewarded, besides his triumph, with a permanent renewal oi
tribunician power ⁸, and a ‘proconsulare impcrium ’ apparently coordinate
rrirh that of rhe princeps ², he had again set out ior Illyricum when the
last illness ot' Augustus recalled him hastily to Italy, which l'or the remain-
ing twenty-three years oi his lise he never quitted.

Our attention throughout rhis period must be mainly directed to the
circumstances which formed the character oi the luture prince. It was
errdendy always the dearest wish ol Augustus to found a family dynasty.
The principare could never be lormally bequeathed ⁸, and, by the tirst
princeps, even the custom oi succession had wholly to be created, but
he seems clearly to have seen that wilh tact and discretion he could
practically name his successor3 and, though a sonless man, had no such
noble ambition as Galba conceived and Nerva realized, ol directing
choice to the worthiest. Yet he could see that his intended successor
must be ripe in years and tried in service, prominent enough ro be such
as a l'ree state might be supposed to choose. Again, the precariousness
of his own health obliged Augustus always to contemplate the possibility
oi a speedy as well as a distant succession. Hence ir was always his
policy to surround his throne with props ⁰, and to have different heirs in
various grades oi cxpectancy. ln the first rank were his nearest relatives,
’ to be bis choice ii time allowed him ro make them sufficiently prominent.
Such in the earlier years was Marcellus. and such in later limes were
Gaius and Lucius Caesar. Secondly‚ there must be another in reserve,
already ripe in years and tried in real lile, who might fill the chief place
