94 INTRODUCTION. [cm. vl.

l'rnd, that even on purely military questions, though their unasked inter·
lerence is resented ¹, they are represented as sharing a responsibility⁸.

To maintain such double government in true equilibrium would be
impossible, even il honestly attempted ; but the hollowness ol this ap·
parent duality is clearly seen, not only in that the power ol the sword is
wholly excepted lrom it, but also in the securities talren by the princeps
to ensure a subservierit senate.

Admission to this body, as well as promotion to its higher ranks, was
ordinarily gained through magistracy; and the abolition ol the comitia
would have lest the senate seli-elective, were not the choise ol candidates
influenced in two distinct modes by Caesar.

(ι’) Any inlluential citizen in the old Republic might inlormally com·
mend a candidate, by introducing him to the tribes, and canvassing l'or
him. Augustus originally supported his friends in this manner ⁸3 but in
and aiter 7⁶1,r.n.8,a lormal written ‘commendatio' is substituted‘.
Hencelorth in each election we have ‘candidati Caesaris ⁸,' in respect ol
whom the comitia, and afterwards the senate, have a mere cong! d'llr're‘3
and this right ol ‘commendatio' is strictly guaranteed in the ‘lex' con·
lerring the principate at each succession' The proportion ol such
candidates is definite, and not large ; in the quaestorship apparently only
two⁸ out ol twenty ¹, in the praetorship lour out ol twelve '⁰ ; with some
unknown proportion ol tribunes and aediles ¹¹.

(a) The presiding magistrate at the old comitia could always reluse to
receive the name ol, and reject votes tendered lor, an unqualilied candi·
date ³⁸. Out ol this grew a right, claimed by Caesar as chiel magistrate,
to ‘ nominate' candidates, as well as to 'commend ¹⁸! Such ‘nominatio'
made by publishing a list ol candidates, implied no more than that they
were qualified to receive votes, and might oontain any number ol names3
but it was the interest, and probably a common practice, ol the princeps,

such reporta become rare except where number. There was also rlght ol commen·
