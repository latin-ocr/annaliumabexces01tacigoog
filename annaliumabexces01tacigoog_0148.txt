illicit might enjoy practical impunity, till circumstances pointed attention
to them3 asin the suppression of Isiac rites by Agrippa ¹ ; or the stern
wengeance taken by Tiberius ou the priests of this cult for a flagrant
moral scandal¹; or the deportation of Jews arising out of a gross pecu·
niary fraud⁸3 the penalty being apparently in neither case such as sensibly
to abate the prevalencc of such worships ⁴.

Nor could any coercion keep out the forbidden mysteries of astrology
and magic⁸3 the former of which had the direct countenance of Tibe·
rius, though his protection of Thrasyllus⁸ did not interfere with the
chastiscrnent of the meaner hcrd’. The influence of all foreign super-
stitione on a less strong mind may be seen in the case of Germanicus;
in the restless search alter foreign oracles, worships, miracles ⁸, which
seems to have so far guided his movcmcnts in the East; and in the
belief shared by his friends as well as himself, that the magician was as
capable of causing his death as the poisoncr ⁹.

. Meanwhile, the only religion capable of taking the place both of the
effete ideas of old Roman worship, and of the gross fanaticisms of foreign

superstition, was known as yet only to a few poor Jews, and hardly
reaches to the outer world till the time of Claudius ¹⁰.
