perilous distinctions ol Rome lor the simple duties ol an aedile at
Ulubrae ¹. Asa lact, the tide still set irom Italy, as irom the rest ol the
world, to Rome: nor do sober critics in any age take the ideal pictures
ol retired lile as altogether serious. However tlre contrasts drawn by
Roman writers are so lar substantiated‚ that Vespasian not only learnt,
in a municipal home, the habits which trained him to be the reformer ol
imperial extravagance; but was also enabled, by a stream ol new men

oi similar origin, to recruit the silete Roman aristocracy with an inlusion
ol healthier blood ¹.

The great work ol Augustus in tlre enlargement and settlement ol the
empire can be bere but very slightly glanced at There appears to be
substantial truth in his boast that he had advanced the limits ol every
province which bad independent nations on its irontier¹; and it we
were to compare the dominion as he lest it with that existing at the date
oi Actium, we should see to how great an extent the coherent ⁸ Imperium
Romanum’ ol our maps was his creation. The conquest ol Gaul had

indeed already pushed the srontier to the ocean, but this was llanlred on
either side by au imperiectly subdued Spain anda wholly free Germany3

avast independent tract surroundcd arrd isolated Italy itseli, Macedonia.
and the subdued portion oi Illyricum ; in the east the provinces os Asia,
Bithynia, Cilicia, have a similar isolated arrd patchworlr character. Nor
in the earlier part ol his sole rule, and the years preceding it, were the
dangers oi even foreign aggression in various parts by any means
visionary. Germans irom beyond the Rhine ravaged Gaul⁴3 a Dacinn
horde svvept over illyricum as lar as Apollonia, and the Bastarnae over
large parts ol Thrace³; Parthia had talen advantage ol the dissensions
ol the triumvirs to hold Syria, Palestine, and Asia lllinor lor two years
at its mercy ‘; in Egypt, Roman territory was invaded by the troops ol
the Nubian queen Candace²3 in Africa the Garamantes and others had
to be kept at further distance ⁸.

Ol all the problema presenting themselves, the most important was
that ol the central European lrontier, and it cannot be matter ol surprise
