mola. Nipp. argues that, as ‘ductus'
means ‘the operation of conducting' ol
water, ‘moles' is ‘the constructiou'
of the rond, as in ‘machinas molemque
operum llatavis delegat' (H. 4 28, 5);

64, ι ; 6. ι7, 4; 45. ι) and to provincial
states (a. 47, 3; 4. 13, ι). Suetonius
(Tib. 47, 48) speaks depreciatingly of
these acts. The genitive with ‘cupiens'
