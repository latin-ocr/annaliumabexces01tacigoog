¹44 INTRODUCTION. [cmvru.

By considering the strength of the impelling motives, we are led to see
a plain truth in the maxim of Domitian at his best time, that ‘the prince
who does not checlr accusers stimulates them¹:’ and there can be no
doubt that Tiberius encouraged them from the first, at least in this sense
aad even in a more substantial manner¹; and that (notwithstanding
a few precedents under Augustus ³) his principate is so marked hythe
development of the profession of delation, chiefly in connexion with
charges of treason, as to be not unjustly termed the period of its origin ⁴.

We must suppose him to have intended the natural consequence, to let
men see that the accuser was always on the watch ⁸, that even trivial acts
or mere words, even the pasquinades so natural to Italian scurrility, were
well within the scope of the law and placed them at his mercy; that by
legal fictions their own household might be forced to be witnesses against
thern ⁸, that whatever could be wrung from tortured slaves was evidence,
that the senate was only too forward to condemn, while the princeps
reserved to himself the credit of extending clemency to the convicted, and
that their life and fortune depended on his forbearance ².

We need not attribute thia to any other motive than to his general
policy of lreeping himself in the baclground and using the instmmentality
of others, and to that constitutions} seli-distrust and suspicion, which
made him even at the outset feel insecure, unless surrounded by an atmo-
sphere of intimidation. On any interpretation, while giving far more credit
thau Tacitus gives at this time fora genuine desire to gosem well, we are
compelled to qualify our praise by ‘si maiestatis quaestio eximeretur!
