1.Α(1). Tus family history ol the Octavii, with further account of tlte
father and mother ol Augustus, is given by Suetonius (Aug. 1-4). The
distinctions oi his lather are enumerated in an inscription (Orell. 592),
which states that he was twice trib. mil, also quaestor, plebeian aedile,
iudex quaestionum, praetor, and proconsul ol Macedonia, where he
became entitled to the name ol imperator. The date ot' his practorship
was 693, tac. ⁶1; and he was prevented lrom becoming a candidate
lor the consulship in 696, tac. 58, by his death at the very beginning
ol that, or at the end os the previous year.

2. lily). The frequency os betrothal, and even nominal marriage,
during mere cltildhood, among Romans at this time (see Friedlaender,
Sitteng. i. p. 504, loll), maltes it possible to reconciie some such a date
as that giren ior Octavia's birth with her betrothai or marriage to
C. Marcellus in 700, sc. 54 ; in which year it was also contemplated
to give her in marriage to Cn. Pompeius (Suet. Jul. 27). Marcellus, who
was a leading opponent ol Julius Caesar, but subsequently reconciled to
him, had just died when Octavia, with contempt lor all usual decorum
(see Dio, 48. 31, 3), was hastily married to M. Antonius in 713, sc. 41,
hy one ol the articles ol the compact at Brundusium. On the honours
paid to her at her death, see Dio, 54. 35, 4, on its date Suet. Aug. 61.

3. Α (4). Octavius assumed the name ol' C. Julius Caesar Octavianus
in consequence ol his adoption by the dictator’s will: hence Cicero
styles him ‘C. Caesar' in official language (Phil. 5, c. 16-19), and some·
times in private letters ‘ Octavianus' (ad Att. 16. 18, 1; 11, 6, etc). On
the subsequent history os his names and titles, sce vi. p. 75, toll. He
had been first betrothed to a daughter ol P. Servilius isauricus; alter-
wards, on his first reconciliation with Antonius, to a step-daughter ol the
latter, Clodia or Claudia, daughter ol Fulvia by P. Clodius. His marriage
with Scribonia was contractetl itt 714, sc. 40, to conciliate Sex. Pom·
peius, whose father-inlati, I.. Scribonius Libo, was her brother. She
was much older than Octavianus, had bct-n twice previously married,
