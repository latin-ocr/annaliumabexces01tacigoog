cinewlt] TIBERIUS AND HIS GOVERNMENT. 157

it rnust be borne in mind, has a purpose to serve, in setting off a special
grievance by a contrast of general beneficence of imperial government ¹.
Seneca speaks most emphatically of the ‘accusandi frequens et paene
publica rabies' which under this prince caused more loss of civic lives
than any civil war 2. The chief definite statement of Josephus, that the
long tenure of office by provincial govemors was the result of a deliberate
intention to make thern less eager pillagers³, reads like the mere excuse
of Tiberius or his friends for the irresolution and dilatoriness of which we
have such abundant other evidence ; and might have seemed questionable
to Josephus himself if he had thought of the ten years of Pilate.

lf we cannot check Tacitus by these, we may in turn check by him the
keener appetite for standai of Suetonius, many of whose tales he must
have known but disdained to notice ⁴, and some of whose generalisations
he has given us the means of teducing to single instances ⁸.

Also his more careful discrimination checks the loose credulity of Dio,
whose bertildered judgment seems at last to take refuge ina desperate
attempt to reconcile conflicting testimony by fusion; in the statement
that Tiberius ‘had many virtues and many vices, and exercised each as if
they had been his only qualities ‘0'

The appeal from Tacitus appears thus to lie to Tacitus alone; to his
candour and sense of truth, to his admissions of fact; against his insinua·
tions and interpretatione of tnotives‚ against his evident prejudices. That
he was no friend to the founders of the principale has been already
shown⁷; and, with all allowance for the sincerity of his disclaimer⁸‚
special grounds of animosity against Tiberius appear discernible. He
had seen in his own day ‘the extremity of slavery, when even the inter·
change of speech and hearing was destroyed by espionage '.' He tracks
back this systematic delation to its source. and, as it were, charges this
prince with its full-developed iniquity; seeing in these trials for treason
far more than the bare facts which he relates, and imagining Carus and
Massa, and the rest of the vile brood of his own time, as already appearing
within view ¹⁰. It would be natural that the memory of the tyrant under
