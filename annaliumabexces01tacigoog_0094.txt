By the end oi the second ‘quinquennium' at the close os 721, nc. 33,
Lepidus had been deposed, and war with Antonius was imminent.
Hence, though Antonius appears to have styled himself ‘triumvir' till
his death¹, Caesartat least in his retrospect) limits the sonnal term ol that
‘office to the ten years¹ ; and then claims a power quasi-dictatorial, or
avirtual concentration ol the whole triumvirate in himself, not, apparently,
hy formal vote, but by general consent. ‘Iuravit in mea verba tota ltalia
sponte sua, et me b[ello] quo viciati Actium, ducem depoposcit ’Β ⁸ Per
consensum universorum [potitus rerum omn]ium' (iydparbe γοόωσα
σάκον νῦν πραγμάτων) ⁴.

Atso, alter a short second consulship in 721,n.c. 33, he enters on
a continuous series ol nine consulships, his third to his eleventh, 723-731,
sc. 31-23 ⁸.

The following inscription oi the year 725, ac. 29, shows the titlcs
which he then bore, but makes no mention oi the tribunician power:-
‘lmp. Caesari, Divi Juli i, cos. quinct, cos. design. sent, imp. sept ⁸.'

We come now to the acts oi 726, 727, sc. 28, 27, the tendency ol
which is described lrom very different points oi view. Caesar himself
claime to have then restored the Republic: ‘Rempublicam ex mea
potestate in senat[us populique Romani a]rbitrium transtuli ².’ This
statement is echoed by writers near the time ⁸, and a coin ,oi this date
describes him as ‘libertatis P. R. vindex '.' On the other hand, Dio
·alludes to this time as the date oi a reestablished monarehy ¹⁰, and
Tacitus as the period when the ascendency oi Caesar was secured ¹¹.
The reconciliation is simple: the extraordinary dictatorial and con·
stituent powers surviving irotn the triumvirate, aiter spending their
force in these enactments¹², are surrendered, and all the arbitrary acts
ol that period cancelled¹³; but the permanent constitution oi the prin·
¹cipate begins. The senate and the comitia resume their regular lunc·
tions; and, aiter an ostensive restoration oi all the provinces, armies,
aud revenues'‘, the unarmed provinces are actually given up, and those
