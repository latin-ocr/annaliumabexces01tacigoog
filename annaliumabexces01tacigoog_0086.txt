able only to the nearest, is also an effort at brevity, even with the risle
of harshness; and is more common in Tacitus than in any other writer.
See the use of redimi 1. 17,6; probabam ι. 58, 6 ; permisit a. 66, 6;

fratres ra. 4, 6; privigni 4. 71, 73 pronepotes 5. ι, 4. Dr. § 639, 3, 4.

3. 69, 5; οι 66 affirmative sense from a negative, as in 12. 64, 6, 63.
