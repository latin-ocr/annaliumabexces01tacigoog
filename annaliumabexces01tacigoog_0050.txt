of reaching truth, by weighing in the scales of justice the indiscriminate

praise or censure of earlier writers. He is more eonscious of the difficulty
of writing on the Flavian eaesars, to whom he was personally indebted· ¹,
than on tlte period covered by tlte Annals, one in which, as he believed,
‘the grounds of resentment or partiality were far removed from him².'

ln one case, when he discusses and rejects a scandalous tale, he begs
the reader to take it as a specimen ⁸, implying that he has rejected many
other such; which a comparison with Dio or Suetonius will sufficiently
confirm. Α single instance may here deserve notice, from the attempts of
commentatore to force it into compatibility with his narrative. Suetonius
tells a story, partly perhaps derived from Seneca* and the elder Pliny ⁶,
that Tiberius, when already princeps, spent thirty-six hours in a con·
tinuous drinking bout with L. Piso and Pomponius Flaccus, both of
whom were rewarded for their boon companionship-‘ alteri Syriam
provinciam, alteri praefecturam urbis confestim detulit⁶.' But according
to the text of Tacitus in the MS, Piso, at his death in 785, a. n. 32, had
been twenty years praefect, and had therefore held that olhce under
Augustus ⁷. Thisis got rid of by the supposition that twenty years
isa round number, or that in some earlier lllS. in which numerals were
used, ‘xx' and ‘xv' have been conlused. But the story limps elsewhere,
for the appointment of Flaccus to Syria cannot he dated before 785,
an. 3²⁸· This again is met hy referring ‘confestim’ to Piso alone;
which, if open to no other objection, spoils the point of the story by
destrnying the plausible connexion of cause and effect, and by making
Suetonius gravely connect this appointment with a debauch of some
fifteen years before it, when the consulship* and the governorship of
Moesia ¹⁰ had intervened. The suggestion is surely more probable that
Tacitus was aware of this story, saw its inconsistency with facts and dates,
and rejected it without even noticing it.

ln spite, however, of his diligence, his firm conviction of his own
impaniality, and his belief that he treads on firmer ground in describing
times further off from his otuu, it has been the general verdict of modern
criticism, that ‘the Histories of Tacitus are more to be relied on than his
Annals¹¹,' and the latter are even maintained to be ‘almost wholly
satire ¹³! The very excellences of the book are also noted as its defects.
