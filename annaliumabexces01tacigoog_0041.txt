24 ΙΝΤ RODUC Τ ΙΟΝ. [csse. lv.

in the later and principa} part of which Tacitus is not known to have
been preceded by any general historian, and is known to have taken
pains in· collecting material and to have had a reputation for ‘dili-
gentia ¹.’ It is thus evident that he had formed a habit of research before
he came to the composition of the Annals.

As regards this work, we have only its own evidence to go upon3
but it seems no more than bare justice to suppose, in the absence of
clear evidence ιο the contrary, that when he expressly states that he has
consulted an author or other source, he has done so, and such references
could hardly be second-hand without some literary dishonesty. This
would apply in one instance to the memoirs of Agrippina ², in another
to the ‘acta publica ³,' in another to the ‘commentarii senatus ⁴,' and in
a few cases to authors not named ⁵.

It should also take positive evidence to make us believe that strong
and general negative expressions· are made wholly without verification,
or that the general imputations of servility or malevolence made against
previous historiens as a whole' do not presuppose some wide reading
and personal research 3 and although in the great majority of references

In the earlier and larger part of the Annals²⁰ he may probably have
