removed by introducingacoordinate ‘legatus Augusti' who had command
61 the troops, and perhaps also some territorial govemment ¹.

The Caesarian provinces¹ can be classihed in three ranlrs, 61 which the
two first answer to the two classes 61 senatorial provinces3 tbe legati
being in the greatest provinces always 61 consular, and in those 61 the
second class, 61 praetorian 11611 ⁸3 although. in recognition 61 the ‘pro-
consulare imperium' as vested in Caesar, all have the 66116116 title 61
‘legati Augusti propraetore,' and the same insignia 61 live fasces, with the
military dress and sword ¹3 their difference 61 rank being only noted by
the addition 61 their titles 61 ‘vir consularis¹,' by those who vere such.
To the highest class belong all those provinces involving important
military commands; 61 which the following had been established at the
death 61 Augustus⁸2 1. Hispania Tarraconensis; a. Gemtania superior ;
3. Germaniainlerior¹3 4. Pannonia; 5. Moesia ; 6. Delmatia (or illyri-
cum) ¹ ; 7. Syria (with Cilicia) ¹. The 11661111 class, aa constituted at the
same period, will comprise: 1. Lusitania; a. Aquitania ; 3. (1111111113-
dunensis; 4. Gallia Belgica ¹⁰3 5. Galatia ¹¹3 6. Pamphylia. A third class
61 provinces had no higher officer than the ‘procurator Augusti,’ who
appears as a subordinate officer in greater provinces ¹¹. To this class
belong at this time¹¹2 1. Alpes Maritimae ; a. Raetia; 3. Vindelicis ¹⁴;
