Vibius Marsus 1.

It was perhaps from such biographies that Tacitus enriched his
record of the soenes ol the last years of Tiberius with cases unknown
to or unnoticed by his usual authorities ⁸.

Collections of letters, similar to those of the younger Pliny, may
also have been made by public men; and the distinguished orators
of the period, such aa Q. Haterius⁴, L. Arruntius 1, Domitius Afer⁸,
and others, were probably in the habit of revising and publishing their
speeches 1. The speech of P. Vitellius at the trial of Cn. Piso· is
referred to by the elder Pliny'.

a. ‘Acta senatus‚' also called ‘acta patrum ¹⁰,' or ‘commentarii
senatus¹¹.' The composition, or at least the publication ol a record
of proceedings in the senate was instituted by Julius Caesar in his
first consulship 11. Augustus is said to have suppressed the publication
of this 1011111111. By the time of Tiberius the senator superintending
the ‘acta' was appointed by the princeps ¹⁴, which suggests the pos·
sibility of garbling the record. Some account of proceedings in the
senate, probably much abridged‚ appears still to have been made public
in the ‘acta populi 11;’ and the archives of the senate themselves would
presumably have been open to a senator. Though Tacitus refers to
them at a later date 11, it has been thought that for the earlier period he
was for some reason unable to consult them 11. lt is certainly remarkable,
that in places where we should most expect a reference to them, other
authorities are cited ¹⁸. We have on the other hand references to extant
speeches or letters addressed by the princeps to the senate 11, which
might more naturally be supposed to exist in the register of its pro·
ceedings than in a separate form; and throughout the narrative, nothing
