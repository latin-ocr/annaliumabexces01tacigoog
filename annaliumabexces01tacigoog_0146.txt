cmvii] ROME UNDER AUGUSTUS AND TIBERIUS. 129

Consonrnnrron or rnc Euoras.

Augustus is said to have bequeathed at his death not a mere aggregate
ol territories, but an organiaed whole ¹, and one which seemed to himself
ιο have reached its proper limit ³. . The administration‚ especially ol the
provinces and annies, was centralized in a way previously unknown,
and the improvement ol roads⁸ and institution oi couriers⁴ gave new
rapidity to inter-communication: and, not to speak oi his periodical
financial statements‘, his summary ol the whole position ol the empire,
publisbed aster his death ⁸, must have given to the senate a new insight
into its organization. ll, beyond this, neither he nor his successor had
devised any pians lor bringing the whole mass into a condition oi horno·
geneous unity, it is none the less evident that tendeucies in this direction
were constantly operating. The practical recognition os common inter·
ests between rulers and ruled; the security ol traffic3 the vast require·
ments ol the city ol Rome, both as regards necessaries oi liie' and
luxuries'; the local centres ot' traffic aliorded especially by camps and
colonies'; must have tended‚ even rnore than the centralized government,
ιο level the barriers oi nations. Two languages again were more and
more taking the place os a Babel ol tongues: the prevalence ol Greek
in the East may be estimated irorn the extent ol its use among even
a race so tenacious ol nationality as the Hebrews ιο; while, in the west,
latin, already prevalent in Gaul, making the vernacular lorgotten in
many parts ol Spain ¹¹, and generally spoken also in Pannonia ¹¹, was ’
not wholly lost even by Rome's bitterest enemies ¹⁸; ancl, as the general
official language oi the empne, had some hold even in the East ¹⁴.

Again, though Tiberius probably imitated the reserve oi Augustus in
bestowing the ‘civitas ¹³ ;' yet even this great equalization ol privilege must
