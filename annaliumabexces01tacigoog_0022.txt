or about an rto-114. lt would thus lali before the publication ol the
Annals, and adds to the interest ol accounts there given ol affairs in that
prosince. Among his friends, besides Pliny, were the latter’s friends,
justus Fabius¹ (probably the consul ol no. roa) and Asinius Rulus²3
and his name appears to occur with other literary mcn in the will ol
Dasumius, dated an. ¹09⁸·

There is no evidence that he outlived Trajan, nor is he known to have
let't any children, buthe was claimed as an ancestor by the emperor
Marcus Claudius Tacitus, in the third century ⁴, and by Polemios, a friend
ol Sidonius Apollinaris, in the filth ⁸. lt was probably at the earlier ol
these dates that the people os Interamna (Temi), the birthplace ol
Tacitus the emperor, claimed the historian also as their citizen} and
erected a tomb to him, which remained till the latter part ol the
sixteenth century, when it was destroyed by order ol Pius V, as that ol
an enemy oi Christianity⁸.

'l'he date ol completion and publication ol his various works rests on
internai evidence.

The Dialogue ‘de Oratoribus’ is, by most critica, accepted as his, and
as his earliest work. It professes to have been written some time alter
the discourse was held ², but can hardly be dated later than the earlier
part ol Domitian's rulel.

The ‘Agricola' belongs to 850 or 851, a.o. 97 or 98. Some expres·
sions in the beginning best suit the time when Trajan was associated
with Nerva. At the end Trajan is styled ‘princeps '.' ’

The ‘Germania' is also to be assigned to the latter ol these years,
from a computation ol time to the second consulship ol Trajan ¹⁰.

The ‘Histories' must have appeared aster the apotheosis ol Nerva, but
probably early in the principale ol Trajan, before the ‘Annals' were even
contemplat ¹¹.

This last work must have been completed when the conquests ol
Trajan had reached their highest point, in 868 or 869, an. ¹15 or rr6,
and belore the retrocession under Hadrian ¹³.
