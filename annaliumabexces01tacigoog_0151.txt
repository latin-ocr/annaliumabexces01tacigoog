It was now that he formed his strange resolution ol retirement to
Rhodes, and with great difficulty obtained the necessary permission².
The conduct ol his wile is assigned as the most potent reason ¹; an in·
liuential second motive can be tracetl in the rise to manhood ol the
young Caesars: and his retirement ol seven years is characterired by
studious, not to say pedantic pursuita ⁴, and initiation by Thrasyllus into
the dangerous mysteries os astrology, which took so lirm a hold upon his
mind ⁸. Alter the banishrnent 01 Julia in 752, ac. a, he had desired,
but had not been permitted, to return. The protection ol his tribunician

operations'was to complete the conquest ol 'the great province in further
Germany, and to secure a lrontier on the lilbe. ln the two campaigns
ol 757 and 758, nn. 4 and 5, the resistance in North Germany appeared
to have been broken; a third campaign was intended, hy a concentrated
