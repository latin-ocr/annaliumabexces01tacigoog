Non-The greatest part of the material of thir portion is derived from Mommren'a
‘ltiimisches Straurecht‚' rolli. part 23 part also from his commentary on the ‘ Marmor
hucyranurnf and froru Professor Pelham'r article ‘princeps' iu Dict. of Ant„

'lua constitution of the principate is dated most properly from the
acts of jan. 13, 727. nc. 27, and froin enactments in the preceding
year; but account must be talten both of powers held by the first
‘princeps' before that date, and of those which he subsequently acquired.

Gaius Caesar Octavianus, in his nineteenth year, had raised forces on
his own authority¹; and his position was legaliaed bya decree of the
senate proposed by Cicero on Jau. r, 711, nc. 43, by which he acquired
the rank of propraetor, with a military imperium² which during the rest
of his long life never left him, so that his ‘dies accepti imperii' is either
reckoned [τοτττ this ⁸, or from the consulship, which on August 19 in the
sume year followed it ⁴, and was his first actual magistracy.

llis permanent imperium, however, during these years comes through
the irregular and mainly usurped powers ο[ the triumvirate; a plebiscite
having been hurried through the comitia on Nov. 27 of the sanie year
