their own gratuitous act. But there are circumstances ol horrible
cruelty in the execution ol the young children ol Seianus ¹, and ol the
aged mother ol Fufius Geminus ¹. and in the causes assigned lor the
destruction oi the descendants ol Theophanes³z and even il these were
all, such cases are hardly palliated by being lew ‘.

lt is difficult to discuss the tales ol abominable prolligacy, which
occupy lour chapters os Suetonius, and not much more than twice as
many lines in Tacitus ⁸. The absence ol indication ol any special source
ltom· which they were derived, or ol any varlance among the authorities
in respect ol them, would suggest that they were found in the writers
whom he chiefly follows ⁸. This would lead us to lay less stress on the
argument that our earlier extant writers, as Philo and josephus, Seneca
and the elder Pliny, show no knowledge os these storias, the more
so as their incidental notices ol Tiberius would not have necessitated the
mention ol what they might have ltnown’. But to suppose such tales to
be partui the general and probably contemporary tradition is in no way
to exempt them irom criticism and they are very strongly criticised.

The age was certainly one os great anti increasing proiligacy‚ but
the prince himsell is represented by hostile authors as shoclting even
the standard ol those times by his enormities, by extreme apologista as
almost alone free from the universal taint, and it is more difficult to
find grounds lor a middle view than to accept either without reserve.
Tacitus asserta that latterly less and less concealmcnt was practised ⁸,
and that victims were sought out lrom lamilies ol position ⁹, Suetonius
has raited together names and details somewhat harder to fabricate
than vague general charges ¹⁰3 but the secluded lite which would
give scope *lor such outrages no less facilitated unlimited invention ol
