Julia was just b0m; and early in 716, nc. 38, took place the marriage
with Livia, which, though contracted under scandalous circumstances,

Cicer0, by whom he had Vipsania Agrippina, married to Ti. Claudius Nero

several inscriptions (Orell. 633-644). Gaius was pontifex, augur, consul

who had previously given him Drusilla in marriage, and meditated desig·
nating him as his successor. See note on ¹4· 2, 4; Dio, 59. 22, 6.
