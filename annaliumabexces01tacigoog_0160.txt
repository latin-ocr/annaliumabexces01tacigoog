numerical list oi such trials becomes considerable, when viewed in relation
to a period os prolonnd tranquillity and acquiesceuce 3 when, with in·
significant exceptions, the air is stirred by no conspiracies ¹, and the
nobles are servile, even to the disdain os their ruler². We arc iar
removed, both from such an open ontbreah in the senate as that which
had forced Angustus to withdraw the ‘Lex lulia maritalis ¹,' and even
srom the independent attitnde ol the Stoic aristocrats under Nero; and
the opposition has shrunlr into epigrams ⁴, the babble ol ‘dinner parties
and places ol resort⁰,' ¹ idle murmurs⁸,' ‘whispers or suspicions silence'3'
in a word, into what no despotism has ever been ,able to repress, and what
no strong govemment need ever consider dangerous.

Nor arethe charges in themselves so noteworthy as the accompany-
ing grovth os an organiaed system ol delation, destined to acquire such
iatal prominence lor nearly a century afterwards. ln Rome, at all times
the absence oi a public prosecutor threw the duty ol accusation on
individuals¹; and the desire to conduct an impeachment was always
strong among Roman orators; all the-more so under the Empire, lrom
the closing ol other roads to distinction, and the increasing prevalence ol
rhetorical schools, in which the brilliant strokes oi a iashionable accuser
are held up to the admiration ol the rising generation'. Even lor men
ol ranlr and wealth ¹⁰, still more lor the needy and obscure ¹¹, such a career
had thus manisold attractions. But Roman moral sentiment drew a strong
distinction between those who had a right to accuse or were deputed to
do so, and those who voluntered sor the duty and made it theirprolessional
