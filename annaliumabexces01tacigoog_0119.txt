munificence ¹. On the other band, the amount oi state and style ol lise’
imposed even on the p0⁰rest would make many anxious to lay down
their rank ³, and many outsiders ol moderate means well-satished not to
enter it ⁴. On the whole, however, such a position was the great object
ol ambition, and admission to its ranlts or a rise in them was sought by
tair means or foul. The base side ol senatorial character is abundantly
brought belore us by Tacitus; on the other hand, it is but sair to recol·
lect that from this class come the series oi provincial gowemors, ol
whom lew are unequal to their place, and many show high qualities os
the soldier and statesman, while ewen so low a nature as that oi L. vitet·
lius rises above itsels under the responsibilities oi power⁸. At home
again even the pliant Ateius Capito shares with his nobler rival Antistius
Labeo the glory ol founding the system oi jurisprudence which forms the
greatest legacy bequeathed by Rome to the world ⁸.

The second or equestrian order had also undergone many changes
under Augu‘stus'; who, besides reconstituting the judicial body into four
decuriae each about rooo strong, ol whom the tirst three were essentially
equestrian⁸, had also reorganized and frequently revised the list ol'
‘equites equo publico: who, as a more select body within the mass, are
alone properly called ‘equites Romani! Their solemn processions were

revivedl, and the expectant heirs ol the empire, Gaius and Lucius,
became their heads, under the title ol ‘principes iuventutis ²⁰! The ‘ius
anulorum,' still, as would appear, not permitted beyond this select body¹',
was further subjected in the ninth year os Tiberius to stringent regula·
tions respecting birth as well ss census ¹'. Within this body again we
