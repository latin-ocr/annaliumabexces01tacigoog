The most peculiar iudicial prerogative, consisting in the right σι’ the
princeps to try offences oi all kinds in a private court oi his own, is
traceable as early as the time oi Augustus ¹. This court, usually, but
not invariably ¹, restricted to cases oi criminals ol rank, probably arises
from the validity oi the ⁴ proconsulare imperium,' and consequent power
oi lise and death, within the pomerium ⁸. lts exercise was optional,
at the request oi the accuser or accused; thus Tiberius was asked
to try Cn. Piso, and, after preliminary investigation, exercised his power
by ‘remitting' the case to the senate¹; upon which it was bis usual
practice ιο devolve judicial responsibility, even in cases most natur·
ally belonging ιο, his personui jurisdiction¹. We find instances oi
such private trials aster his retirement to Capreae ¹, though even then
be more commonly calls in the consuls and senate to pass sentence on
tbe record sent to them ¹. Alter him, these private courts becarm such
an engine oi tyranny¹ as to lead ιο a reaction at the accession oi Nero¹
and again under the first Flavian Caesars¹¹. Proin this high criminal
jurisdiction flows that delegated ιο others, as ιο the ‘praelectus urbi'
at home ¹¹, and ‘ legati' in the provinces, who however were obliged ιο
allow the appeal ιο Caesar, in capital charges affecting a Roman
citizen ¹¹.

The civil jurisdiction oi the princeps sitting personaily, whether aa
a court oi first instance or oi appeal, is also found as early as the tirne
oi Augustus ¹¹ and Tiberius ¹¹. This also might be, and was delegated,
with appeal from the delegate to the delegant. On this subject most oi
the information comes irorn Jurivts oi much later date ¹¹.

We also trace an iniormal board oi assessore as well as delegates,
from the earliest date ¹⁸ till the retirement to Capreae, and again under

own sentences, and that any mbsequent isaspecial privilege oi the princeps. lex
