cnara] GENUINENESS OF THE ANNALS. 9

ternal evidence to show that it is at least the work os an ancient
author.

We have no reason to suppose that any scholar ol the time oi
Bracciolini had access to historiens ol this period who are lost to us.
Even those whom we have must have been known to him only in
manuscripts The inventor ol a Tacitean history of the principate oi
‘liberius or Nero must act as any scholar would now have to act who

desired to compose a Tacitean history ol that ol Gaius or Domitian. He
must make the best use ot' Dio Cassius and Suetonius, and ol whatever
could be gleaned from other authors, and must invent the rest ol the
material, as well as the form and language. Any carelul comparison
ol the Annals with these sources will show how large a proportion
ol the whole narrative as it stands will have to be set down thus¹ to
invention; and in testing such a theory, the details become important,
almost in proportion to their intrinsic unimportance.

Is it ean be shown that even a moderate number ol facts, such as
would be unlikely to occur to an inventor, stated in the Annals, and in
no other extant author, are confirmed by coins and inscriptions, most
ol which were certainly, and allos them probably. unknown in the
filteenth century; the supposition ol so many felicitous accidents will
be generally conceded to pass the bounds ol reasonable probability.

ln the Books comprised'in the first llledicean MS, the following con·
firmations, most os which are already well known to editors, will be
round:-

ι. Germanicus is stated to have been augur ¹, flamen ¹, and irn-
perator ⁸; and all these titles are confirmed ⁴.

a. llis eldest son Nero is stated to have been espoused to the
daughter ol Creticus Silanus ⁶. An inscription gives the name ‘Ium'a
Silani [s., spem]su Neronr'r Caedem] ’.’ »

3. The honours decreed to Germanicus at his death are enumerated ⁷,
and in another place it is stated that those decreed to Drusus were in
the main the same ⁸. The remains ol tablets recording these decrees,
though extremely fragmentary, appear to suggest confirmation ol some
ol the details, such as the insertion of the name in the Salian hymn,
the exhibition of the effigy at the '‘Circensesf and the erection ol arches
(Jani) at three different places ⁹.

4. 1„ Apronius, and P. Cornelius Dolabella, stated to have been at

difierent times proconsuls ol Alrrca ¹⁰ are shown to have been so by
