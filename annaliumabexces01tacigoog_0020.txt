emt] LIFE AND WORKS OF TACITUS. 3

deiects¹, corrected in his own case by an ardent study ol the great
classical models oi Roman eloquence, particularly Cicero. He lays
the sceneos this Dialogue in 827, ruo. 74 ', when he would be not more
than twenty, possibly not more than eighteen years oi age; and repre·
sents himself in it as even then on terms ol friendship with the leaders
oi the Roman bar'. There is considerable probability in the suggestion
that he was also at some time a pupil oi Quintilian ⁴.

Three years later, Cn. Julius Agricola, who had already reached the
first rank in the state, and established the reputation which he was
alternards to extend, selected him, a young man ol irum twenty-one
to twenty-three, as his son in·law¹. The rank, and the personal chor·
aeter oi Agricola, justily us in assuming. that the chosen husband ol
his daughter would bea young man not only ol moral excellence, but
oi already assured position and promise.

Some two to four years later, he entered the senate as quaestor ⁸. By
the age ol thirty-two or thirty-four, he had attained‚ besides the praetor-
ship, a place among the ‘Quindecimviri sacris faciundis ',' one ol the old
priestly colleges, the members ol which were generally men oi good ranlt
and family.

Up to this time Tacitus may be assumed to have lived in Rome,
employed chiefly in the lorensic practice, his eminence in which has
been described hy Pliny; perhaps also occupied in such literary worlt
as could be saiely pursued, or in collecting material ior greater things in
contemplation.

During the next iour years, lrom 842 to 846, so. 89 to 93, he was
absent from Rome ⁸. probably in command ol some Caesarian province
ol the second rank’. That ol Gallia Belgica has been suggested, as
aposition in which he may have acquired such personal knowledge as
be shows respecting the German peoples.
