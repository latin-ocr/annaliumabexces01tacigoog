‘intercessio ¹.' Ol the quaestors, tvo are charged with communication
between Caesar and the senate¹; four, until the time os Claudius, have
‘provinciae’ in Italy’3 one is attached to each consul‘; one accom-
panies the proconsul to each senatorial province ‘. This office would he
alsrays keenly sought‘, as admitting to the senatorial rank avith all its
duties and privileges ; the praetorship and consulship, again, would be
the highest objects os senatorial ambition, not only as adding to the
‘nobilitas’ ol families, but as stepping·stones to provincial govemments;
the praetorship to those ol the second rank, the consulship, both to the
greater Caesarian provinces and to the great senatorial prizes oi Asia
and Africa ². On the other hand, the offices os aedile and tribune,
though one or other seems usually to have sonned part ol the ‘cursus
honorum‘,' had so sar fallen into disrepute‚ that properly qualilied
candidates were apt to be wanting‘. The lesser magistracies, held
before the quaestorship, and osten collectively designated as the ‘viginti-
viratus ¹‘,’ consisted oi four separate boards. (t) The ‘tresviri capitales'
were still charged vrith the duty os executing capital sentences, buming
boolrs, ἀς. “; but their summary jurisdiction at the Moenian column ¹¹

soon probably vholly or mainly passed to the praelectus urbis. (a)
The ‘tresviri monetales,' or ‘tresviri aere argento auro flando feriundo'

must have had their office restricted to the copper coinage still atnrck hy
the senae. Their names disappear from the coinage from and alter
the laten years ol Augustus “. (3) The ‘quattuorviri viis in urbe pur·
gandia ' appear to have been subordinate officers to the aediles ¹‘. (4)
The ‘decemviri stlitibus iudicandis,' a very old separate board, became
now presidents ol the centumviral courts ¹⁸. 'lt is evident that all these
greater and lesser magistracies filled considerable departments os the
home govemment; and it is also known that the concurrent, and, ulti·
