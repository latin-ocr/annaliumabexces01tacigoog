Gracchus with him ranks no higher than Saturninus ¹; not eren Sulla
or Pompeius had disinterested aims ¹3 the dictatorship oi the first Caesar
seems only to iorm part ol the twenty years ol anarchy⁸. There are in·
dications enough that his view oi Augustus was as different from that
oi Vergil or Horace as his Tiberius srom the Tiberius oi Velleius ⁴.
The ‘weariness ol civil switet' which had followed Actium was em·
ployed by Augustus first ιο ‘secure his own ascendency,’ and then to
give ‘laws which we were to enJ'oy in peace and under monarchy⁶.'
From this time ‘theold morality disappeared in the revolution; men
cast acide their position os civic equality and looked sor orders to the
prince¹;’ hence begins the servile age ol sycophanta and courtiers.
The restoration ol the Republic is still so iar conceived to have been
possible ⁸, that Germanicus and his father are imagined to have contem·
plated it ¹, and popularly held to have been victims ol' their love ol
liberty ¹⁸. The vices ol the senatorial rule, the improvement oi pro·
vincial administration under the empire, are ignored even at the mo·
ment when they are admitted ¹¹ ; and the first Caesars are assumed to
be mainly responsible lor the degradation which had changed the
senate that conlronted Pyrrhus or Hannibal to that which had dragged
its own rnemhers ιο prison at the bidding ol Domitian ¹¹.

Our estimate must also talre account oi the author'a literary ten·
dencies. ln one sense, not the Annals alone, but all the worlrs os
Tacitus are satire; ior satire, in the various forms which it took under
Persius, Petronius, hiartial, Juvenal, was the chiei literary force oi the
age¹³; and a writer out ol harmony with the times ol which he writes
had a whole armoury ol sharpedged maxims ready to his hand. ‘ln-
