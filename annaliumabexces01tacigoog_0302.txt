ment eld throughout the lisetime ol
Sabinus, and was continued under bis
successor Memmius Regulus. and ap·
parently till the restoration os these pro·
vinces to the senate (1616764). Tacitus
bears out this account by speaking ol
him as commanding in the Thracian war
troops sent lrom Moesia (4. 46-51), as
governing Macedonia and Achaia stttt
later (5. ιο, 3), and us holding ‘maximae
provinciae’ up to his death (see note

above). On the other hand be mentions

at various times other governors ol Moe·

Pomponius Labeo in 779· ab. 16(4. 47,

who was appointed lor a special arpose,
is known to have been a consular, and
Labeo was certainly not such (see on
4. 47, 1). 11 is therefore possible that
these were subordinate to Sabinas, whose

Hence Em. aud others refer this term
here to the senatorial provinces. But
only the direct appointments oi Tiberius
seem here spoken ol, aud among the
Caesarian there were peacelul provinces,
to which the term may well be applied.

ceusu, &c 'l'o those here mentioned
may be added that which Josephns (Ant.
18. 6, 5) quotes as assigned by Tiberius
himself, that ‘it is better to leave the
gorged llies on a sore thau to drive them
ott’ (see introd. viii. p. 157);111κ1 the
complaint, also alleged by himself, that
the best men constantly declined tbe
