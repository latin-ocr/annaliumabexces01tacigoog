attends him into his retirement ¹, and to the survival of another version of
his life there in the satirist’s description of him at the time of the fall
of Seianus as surrounded by no worse than a crevv of astrologers³. In
this weakness of evidence, it is natural that great stress should be laid
on the strong intrinsic improbability that a seli-control apparently well
sustained to the age of severity should then altogether give vray, and
that alife of such sensuality should last without medical aid to nearly
seventyeight. Upon the whole, therefore, the most just as rvell
as the safest verdict appears to be that of acquittal, or at least ‘not
proven ‘.’

There are still flashes of vigour, as in the blow which struck down
Seianus ; and the display os energy in the East into which the taunts
of the Parthian king had goaded him l. Again, if he was keen to lill
the ‘fiscus⁸,' he could still be munificent in the use of it, either to
