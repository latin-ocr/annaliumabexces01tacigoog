cm.1v.] TACITUS’ Usu OF HIS MATERIALS. 29

lt is with these purposes that we are to suppose him to have dealt
with his materials; on these that his sense of historical proportion, in the
topics tnade more or less prominent or wholly omitted, may be taken to
be mainly grounded¹. Eren granting the defects incident to history
thus written for a purpose; his aim and range of subject elevate his
work above mere biographies‚ such as those of Suetonius. llluch as all
history at such a time must dwell on the personal qualities of the prince,
he has never made these his subject in themselves; but always in some
subordination to their effect on the personal govemment and admini-
stration of the empire. The designation of his work by St. Jerome,
as ‘Lites of the Caesars ¹‚' needs but to be mentioned, to show its entire
inadequacy.

Yet again, the purpose in view alone justifies to himself, and is expected
to justify to the reader, the monotony of his theme ; the weary record of
‘cruel mandates, perpetual accusatione, treacherous friendships, destruc-
tion of the guiltless'3 forming in his mind so painful a contrast to the
roll of foreign conquesta and great domestic struggles which his prede·
cessors were privileged to unfold ³. llluch indeed that would have been
far more interesting to ourselves has thus been sacrificed but he is at
’ least entitled to the credit of having adhered steadily to his plan ⁴.

The apparent inconsistency in the profession of a didactic purpose by
au author who inclines to fatalism, is to be met by showing that the
opinions of Tacitus on this subject are neither so prominent nor so
definite as to make such inconsistency palpable‚ and that the saving
clauses in his creed evidently sufficed to prevent his being himself
perplexed by it.

The principal passage on the subject does not directly treat of the
freedom of human action, but raises the question whether prosperity and
adversity and the chief occurrences of life are due to chance or fate⁶.
