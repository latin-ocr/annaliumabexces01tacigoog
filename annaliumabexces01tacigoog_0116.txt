of precedents in the ‘lex’ os his successor ¹, or by the milder inpia ol
rehrsing deification'. Among other lormidable ‘secret principles os the
constitution’ revealed in Bar, nn. 68, was also this, that the senate could
even unmalre and outlaw a living princeps, through theold formula,
invoked by Tiberius against his own natural heirs ³, oi declaring him
a public enemy ⁴.

without doubt the early principes owed much ol the stability ol
their rule to their subtle manipulation ol republican ideas. Not even
‘the extinction oi the bolder spirits by proscription and battle ⁵, and the
growth oi ‘a generation bent on slavcry⁸,’ helped them more than
the homage pald at least in the letter to constitutional forms, the respect
ior which, eren in the character oi fictions and survivals, is so marked
a trait oi the Roman mind; especially ata time when demoralisation
and its remedies were aliire leit to be burdensome', and men could
neither bear complete bondage nor complete liberty ⁸. ll Julius Caesar
might have pleaded that he had but gone a step further on the path oi
Sulla; Augustus, with iar more prudence, made a show ol imitating
the great autocrat nithe aristocracy only in his wish to abdicate3 while
ruling under more slrillul disguisc, and with more complete precedente.
Men might recollect, and were, no doubt, industriously reminded, that
even his more irregular powers were severally such as their fathers had
acquiesoed in: that there had always been a constitutional right to com·
mend and to reject candidates sora magistracy': that the senate had
been always in theory no more than an advising body: that a‘cohors
praetoria⁸ was asold as the days os Scipio Africanus ¹⁰: that Gracchus
bad contemplated, and partly realised‚ a continuity ol ‘tribunicran
ponerr' that Marius and Sulla, and still more Pompeius, and yct more
recently Cassius ¹¹, had held an ‘imperium maius,’ embracing more than
oue province: that Pompeius again, most dangcrous innovator oi all, had
been adrniral oi the state, with power to send his fleets where he would ¹¹ ;
and had even been consul at horne, while holding ‘proconsulare im·
perium' abroad, administered by legati in his name ¹⁸. lt was by
