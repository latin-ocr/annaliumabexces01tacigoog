moderna critica storicu (Milan, 1887). Among English vorke the most thorough·
going defenoes of Tiberius are those by Professor Beesly (Cutiliae, Clodius, sud
Tiberius, london, 1878) and by Mr. Rering Gould (Tragedy of the emm, london,
1892), and the most bulsnced judgmeut is that of Desn Merivsle (flue Vol. v).
A clear and fair estimste is also mrsu in the Introduction to Professor Allcn's
, edition (1890).

Many obligations, not easy to specify lu their places, must be herc sckuowledgcd to
several worlrs, especially that of Professor Gentiles but my chief endeavour has been
to give an independent judgment on the fscts sud interpretations of facts contained in
'l‘acitus aud other original authorities

Tncrws would undoubtedly wish his readers to take, as his most
deliberate judgment on Tiberius, the summary at the end of the Sixth
Book, where his lile is marked out into perfode, showing a gradual
moral deterioration, affecting both his private habits and personal
government ¹. It will therefore be convenient to examine these suc·
cessively.

1. ‘Egregium vita famaque quoad privatus vel in imperiis sub Augusto
vixerat!

This emphatic praise, from so unlavourable a witness, though perhaps
qualified by insinuatione of latent cruelty²‚ and tales, which we seem
intended to believe, of a foretaste at Rhodes of Capreae ⁸, must at least
he taken as an admission that bis public life to his fifty-sixth year was
unimpeachable‚ and seems to carry with it a disbelief in the tales of
drunltenness caught up by Suetonius ⁴.

‘From earliest infancy, his lot was one of peril ⁸! Born in the
year of Philippi⁸ (712, mc. 41), he shared in the very beginning of life
the hurried flight of his parents from Perusia: he was only four years old
when his mother became the wife os the triumvir; only nine' when his
father's death transferred him to the tutelage of his stepfather‚ who two
years later became the undisputed master of the Roman empire. From
this point, his life, in the judgment of popular exaggeration, seemed
enviable in the extreme. lle is ⁴ brought up from childhood in areigning
family, loaded with consulships and triumphs in his youth ⁸! To a more
careful observer, the thirty-five years next ensuing are a history of
harassing intrigues and rivalries' and souring disappointments, hardly
compensated by ultimate success. ¹
