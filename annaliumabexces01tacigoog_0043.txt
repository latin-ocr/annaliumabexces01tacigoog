26 INYRODUCTION. [cmv. fv.

speaking generally, we find that Tacitus disdains all notice of adula-
tory writers ; the contrasted opinions being generally more or less hostile;
that he only names his chief authors where they disagree¹, but that he
sometimes checks them by other sources ¹, and does not always follow
the same authority in his earlier and later works ¹.

The points of contact between Tacitus and Suetonius, more numerous
in the earlier⁴ than in the later Books of the Annafs¹, and far more so in
the Histories than in either ⁸, do not decide the question whether the latter
author used the former or both followed s common source ¹. On the
whole, the differences are far greater than the resemblances, as might be
expected frunt the individualities of the writers, and from the different
point of view of a biographer and a historiast. Suetonius probably used
more numerous sources ⁸, but took only what suited him from each.

In the case of Dio, even where some direct use seeum indicated ¹, the
question is complicated hythe long interval of time, allowing the sup·
position that he may have known Tacitus through intermediate works ¹⁰.
We should not suppose that the writer of a complete Roman history
could use many sources for any one period, but it is to be noticed that
he often gives particulars omitted by Tacitus and sometimes adopts
a different scale of proportion ¹¹.
