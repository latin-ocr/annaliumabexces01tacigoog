When, for instance, we are given to suppose that Tiberius at the age ol
nineteen had almost saved Rome lrorn lamine as quaestor¹; and at
twenty-five had virtually subjected Armenia and terrified Parthia¹3 we
are forced to ask how much similar exaggeration may lurk in the history
oi the German and lllyrian campaigns. Sometimes, too, this rhetoric is
conironted by stubbom realities. Against the alleged all but complete
subjugation ol Germany⁸ must be set the lact, that the single deleat and
annihilation os a force ol some 3⁰›000 men rolled back the tide ol cou-
quest stom Germany, not temporarily, but lor ever. The account ol the
passionate enthusiasm, with which the legions are said to have welcomed
Tiberius ou his return ⁴, must be read in the light ol our knowledge that
his name teu years later had assurediy no magic, either ior veteran or
recruit, among the armies that had known him best Even Julius Caesar
had to lace the mutiny ol a legion; but popular generals have not oiten
been met by the wholesale defection oi their armies ⁸.

In the notice by Velleius oi this principate, we have no right to expect
details from asketch oi sixteen years contained in eight chapters; yet his
suppressions at times are most significant F our years had passed since
Tiberius had permanently lest Rome⁸3 yet his retirement is not even
glanced at. On all the state trials os these years, we have only a line in
reproach oi the crimes os Libo Drusus, Silius, aud Piso'3 aud a hint
ol the shame aud sorrow supposed to have been felt at the conduct
oi Agrippina and Nero ⁸. We seem forced to conclude that on these
subjecta the silence oi Velleius is more eloquent than the epigrams ol
Tacitus ⁸. Are we prepared, again, to talre his verdict on Seianus as well
as on his master? to see iu him the Laelius to this Scipio, the Agrippa
or Statilius Taurus to this Augustus¹⁰l The impression lest upon us
becomes on the whole that oi a fairly skillul apology, saved from palpable

salsehood by ignoring what it is difficolt to defend, and laying stress upon
what is undeniably praiseworthy.

On other authors less need here be said. No critic will expect to find
