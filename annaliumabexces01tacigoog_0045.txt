it the chief office ol history to rescue virtue lrom oblivion, and that base
words and deeds should have the lear ol posthumous inlamy¹.'

Even his own age, he leels assured is not without noble characters
deserving ol such record. The operation ol traceable causes, or even
the revolution ol a kind ol cycle, can again bring good aiter evil, as
lertile succeed to barren seasons². An Agricola is as worthy ol' imita·
tion as the heroes ol antiquity‚ and, by being recorded lor posterity, may
receive the imperishable statue erected by druse whose lives are formed
-οη hist ·

We may compare with this the nearly similar moral purpose professed
by Livy; to lead men to avoid the evil and choose the good, by exhibit-
ing the intrinsic character and consequences oi both. ‘This lt is that is
so salutary and lruitlul in historical study, that you see specimens ol
every type ol character conspicuously displayed; and may hence take
models lor yoursell and your country to imitate, or instances ol whatis
vile in its beginning and issues, to avoid ‘.’

Side by side with this runs another, but a closely connected purpose,
that ol being the means oi teaching a political wisdom suitable to the
times. He reminds the reader, that as men had ol old to study the
tempers ol the aristocracy or the people, so, under a virtual monarchy,
even the apparent trilies which he collects and puts on record will
have their use, as rnen learn what is advantageous or pemicious more
readily lrom the examples ol others than from any lorethought ol their
own ⁶.

This purpose, though apparently less exalted than the other, airus no
less in result at elevating the character ol public men. For the lesson
which he desires to teach is that ‘even under bad princes there cart be
good citizens ζ’ and that the most admirable is generally also the most
successlu13 neither the base courtier wh0, by any reaction, or even by
the mere desire lor a new instrument ⁷, is unmade in a moment by the
breath that made him, nor the proud and impracticable ‘irreconcileabless
like Helvidius Priscus, who ostentatiously ilings away his lile ⁸, but the
dignified reserve and moderatiora, ¹ removed alike lrom perilous disrespect
and loathsome servility,' which sustained the position ol a Manius Lepidus
under Tiberiust, a Memmius Regulus under Nero ¹⁰, andan Agricola
under Domitian ¹¹.
