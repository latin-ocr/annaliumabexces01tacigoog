cm. vl] CONSTITUTION OF THE EARLY PRINCIPAYE. 97

curule cheir, the laurei-vreath and lictors ¹. His household troops keep
the old title ol ‘cohors praetoria.¹ Nor is Dio right in representing him
ss ‘legibus solutus‘3' his special exemption from some laus³ implying
that be is bound by all others. Again, his lamily have no dignities

except by special deeree. Livia, tbe type in early times oi exceptional <

female privilege, received tribunician sanctity, and was made ‘sui iuris'
111 her huabaud's liletime‘: ber honours at his death were strictly
limited⁸3 ber deification at the time oi her death relused ⁶ ; her political
influence was only personal: not till aster Domitian does ‘Augusta'
becorm a regular title': only Agrippina seems substantially ιο share
the poverol' husband or son, and to be in very deed an ‘cmpress⁸:'
the associatiou ol the sisters ol Gaius in the oath' seems a mere ireak
oi power: sons ol the mling house are no more than, and are not
always, ‘principes iuventutis ¹⁰’ in youth; and are afterwards enabled
only by special decree¹¹ to forestall the laviul age lor magistracies: the
housebolds ol Caesar are at iirst no greater than those ol other eminent

citizens ι’; his secretaries, accountants, etc„ no higher than lreedmen. ⁴

lt was however inevitable that the extreme importance ol the office
should exalt its holder, and we lind by the time oi Claudius that his
three priucipal lreedmen, especially the chiel treasurer ol his ‘fiscus'
have beoome the most important functionaries in the state ¹⁸.

Nor could the princeps lormally name a successor; much as he could
do indirectly ιο guide the choice ol one. The person leit heir in his
'vill had a position ol vantage by succeeding to the ‘fiscus' in which
public money vas mingled with the ‘res privata principis ε’ yet neither
Livia¹⁴ nor Tiberius Gemellus ¹⁸ acquired by heirship any share ol
empire An act ol adoption hythe princeps is figuratively called by
Tacitus ‘comitia imperii ¹⁸3¹ but such adoption was not limited to one ¹⁷,
