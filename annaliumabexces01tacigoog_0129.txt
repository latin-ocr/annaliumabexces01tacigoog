Libyan (or Berber) peoples ¹, as distinct from the abode of the Aethiopian
and Gaetulian races.

The most permanently important change dating from Augustus in the
administration of the provincial empire is the division ol it between
himself and the senate ¹. Out of the distinct govemments, about thirty
in number ³, subsisting at his death, only the following, aad these not at
all times, remain in the hands of the senate: 1. Sicily; a. Sardinia and
Corsican 3. Hispania Baetica; 4. Gallia Narbonensis; 5. lllacedonia;
6. Achaia¹; 7. Asia3 8. Bithynia (with part of Western Pontus);
9. Cyprus; ιο. Crete and Cyrenaica‘; 11. Africa (with New Africa or
Numidia). lt hasbeen mentioned above' that the govemors of these
provinces were appointed usually by lot, with annual tenure; Asia and
Africa being reserved for consulars, the others, as a rufe, given to
‘praetorii3’ but that both classes of govemors are properly styled pro·
consuls ⁸, and have, as in old times, each his attendant quaestor; and
also, in praetorian provinces one, in consular three ‘legati'5' who are
styled ‘legati propraetore ⁰,' though sometimes even consulare ¹¹. The
proconsul received a salary from the treasury¹² and had also the lictors
and other insignia of his rank, except the military dress and svvord,
withdrawn to denote that he had no longer power to execute a soldier ¹³. -

Some further checlt was placed on him by the presence of a Caesarian
officer, the ‘procurator hsci,' whose functions, originally strictly limited ¹⁴,
received such extension as to encroach considerably on those of both
quaestor and proconsul ¹⁸.

Some illustration of the mode of appointment to and tenure of these
proconsulares may be drawn from such lists as can be compiled of the
