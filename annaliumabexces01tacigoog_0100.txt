admiral ol the empire, with fleets near at hand ι; and, besides the troops
stacheo to these, not only the praetorian guard, his proper household
brigade, but even the police and night-watch ol the city, owned no
allegiance to any magistrate ol the republic, but only to Caesar and his
praelecta, and formed no insignificant loroe athis disposal on the spot²;
while the validity ol his imperium within the walls explains his power to
put to death citizens even of senatorial rank⁸: and he is so lar the
‘imperator' ol the whole Roman world, that the whole senate and
people, and even the provinces, take the ‘sacramentum' in his name,
fflding themselves in the most solemn terma to maintain his authority
against all enemies, and not to hold even their own children dearer⁴. s
Naturally, in time the ‘imperator’ and ‘ princeps‘ became synonymous⁸,
and this power was held sufficient in itseli to constitute a principate;
and, although sormally given by senatorial decree, retained an ominous
memnryol theold popular or military origin ol an ‘imperator's' title ⁸,
and ol the irregnlar democratic command ol Augustus ‘hy universal
consent ',' out ol which this form ol ‘imperium' had risen; so that even
a constitutional nrler lilre Vespasian takes the salutation and ‘sacra-
mentum' ol the soldiers as a valid title, and rechons from it, not lrom
the senatorial decree, his ‘dies accepti imperii ⁸.' Hence the revelation
ol that ‘atate secret' so lrultlul in subsequent history, that ‘a ‘⁴ princeps ''
could he made elsewhere than at Rome'5' and hence the ‘imperaton’
even in prolound peace, lelt that ‘he held a woll by the ears¹⁸,' and
was sale only as long as the soldiers were contented.

IL The uibunician power, which had belonged, as we have seen, in
some lorm to Augustus lrom a very early stage ol his career, and to the
dictator helore him, still more emphatically recorded the democratic
character ol Caesarism, and was not, like the formal offioe ol tribune,
antenable hya patrician. Gracchus and others had shown the lormid-
abie politica! strength oi the tribunale, not only as regarded its wide and
indefinite coercive powers, but also in italegislative initiative. Experience
had no less shown its inherent weaknesses, the liability to paralysis by
. the veto ol a colleague, the annual tenure with a doubtful chance ol
reelectiom and the want ol armed support in case ol the last appeal to
