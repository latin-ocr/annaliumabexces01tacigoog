mitior quia toleraverat¹:' ‘acerrima proximomm odia' :' ‘causae in·
imicitiae acriores quia iniquae³:’ ‘proprium humani generis odisse
quem laeseris‘'-these and a hundred such are the forms in which
the stern and bitter experiences ol the historian’s lile express themselves.
There are no such arrows in the quiver oi Augustan literature; they are
hardly so barbed even in Juvenal. Again, we have the satiric tendency,
prevalent especially in the Annals, to take extreme acts as typical ol the
man, and extreme men as typical ol the age. Not, however, that such
exaggerations are on one side only: the great literary artist knows too
well the effect oi a heightened eontrast to neglect the opportunities held
out to him. Even on such neutral ground as the subject of the
‘Germania' this is thought to have affected the historical fidelity ol

Tacitus ; and in the portraiture ol Rome under the Caesars, the tempta· ’

tion was lar more irresistible. Hence the eliort to idealiae a Germanicus,
a Corbulo, or an Agricola, and others who might be mentioned; and the
tendency to surround with glory the death-scene ol tlte martyra.

Between this sharply·drawn contrast ol hideous vices and heroic
virtues, the neutral multitude ol ordinary men on the dead level ol
average mediocrity ol character in all ranks ol tite, however deeply
interesting to those who would truly trace the general tendencies olan
age, lade as completely out ol sight as the shadowy rank and lile ol
the Homeric armies.
