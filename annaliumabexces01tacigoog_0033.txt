as Pliny speaks of his own continuation of it as a ‘history of his own
times ¹.'

The combined works of Bassus and Pliny would cover more than
the whole period included in the Annals². Many facts are also known
to us through allusions in the Natural History of the latter author arrd
in the works of Seneca and of Josephus, andin the interesting contem·
porary view 'of Gaius given by Phiio⁸. But the chief authorities used
by Tacitus in the later Books must have been those aliuded to by him ⁴.
Of these, M. Cluvius Rufus is known to us aa a consular before the
death of Gaius⁸‚ the companion of Nero to Greece', legatus of Spain
under Galba', and aa one of the train of Vitellius⁸. llis work has
been thought ιο have begun as early aa the tirne of Gaius; it would
appear to have gone down ιο the death of Vitellius ⁹, whom the historiari
outlived byabouta year. From aremark addressed by him to Verginius ¹⁰
we should gather that he had a high view of the obligations of a historiari.
Pliny, though no doubt diligent, would seem, ιο have been somer-hat
uncritical ¹¹ and accumulative¹¹. The third, Fabius Rusticus, is described
as too partial ιο his patron Seneca, but as being in eloquence and
brilliancy the Livy of his age ¹⁸. ris he described Britain, his work
probably began not later than the time of Claudius ¹⁴. We have no
allusion to it later than the time of Nero, but he appears to have been
still living in the midst of the principare of Trajan ¹¹. These writers do
not quite belong ιο the same generation. Αι the death of Nero, Cluvius
