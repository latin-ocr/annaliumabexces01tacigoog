Tiberius¹.’ Onlya passing reference can here be made to the exceptional
knowledge possessed by Tacitus of this province ¹, to its prominence in
the business before the senate ³, and to the evidence of its great resources
and high civilisation at all times ⁴, as well as of its gradual recovery from
the ravages of war and extortion¹; and the general qualities which, in
spite of imperial vigilance, made it in the time of Nero, hardly less
than in that of Cicero ⁸, a snare to govemors.

recess of the Great Syrtis, near hluhktar3 while on the west, during the
independence of Mauretania, the boundary between them was fixed at
Saldae ⁸, identified with deJiya (Bongic). lt had thus acoast line
extending some fifteen degrees of longitude, and comprising the greater
part of modern Tripoli, the whole of Tunis, and a considerable portion
of Algeria. ln the time of Pliny it contained thirty ‘civitates liberae:
fifteen ‘oppida civium Romanorum,’ and six coloniae ’3 the most famous
towns in these two latter classes respectively being Utica and
eanhagev.

arariam of Tacfarinas ¹¹ ; but there is abundant other evidence that Africa
vas in many respects the most important senatorial government, and
therefore with reason the most jealously watched by Caesar. Next ιο
Egypt it was the most important source of the corn supply of Italy ¹²:
and, probably on this account, the proconsul was assisted or controlled
not by one, but by two or more ‘ procuratores fisci ¹³) Again, here alone
the senatorial proconsul has regular command of a legion ²⁴, and the
chanoe of winning military renown; an exceptional position which Gaius
