who held the ‘imperium’ ol the state, and the authority ol the senate
to ‘give laws' in its name ¹. Many such imperial ‘leges datne' are
mentioned, and lragments ol some are preserved'; many ol them giving
colonial or municipal rights ³, or ordaining statutes lor such corn·
munities ⁴. Again, the citizenship, formerly given, as a rule, by plebiscite,
but often also through authority committed to commanders, as Marios,
Pompeius, dest, is now lormally given by the princeps, both to in·
dividuals‘, usually as the reward ol service in the auxiliary lorces',
and also to whole communities'. The legal force oi these edicts and
rescripts, though strictly limited to the lile ol the princeps, was in most
cases permanent through confimation ol his ‘acta’ alter his death.

Again, by his indirect and direct judicial power, he became practically
the sole t'ountain oi justice. Besides lraming the lists ol ‘iudices
selecti ',’ and regulating their duties ¹⁰, Augustus hod, in 726, nc. 28,
‘and olten afterwards,’ selected the ‘praetor urbanus‚' ‘extra sortem ¹¹.'
The princeps frequently sat as assessor at the praetor's side ¹¹, and even
in absence appears to have been treated as present hythe fiction ol
a ‘calculus Minervae’ deposited in his name¹'. Tiberius constantly
presides in person at the senatorial high court ol justice ¹², influencing
it by his manner ¹⁸ no less than his vote; and exercises his power ol
intercession, whether in refusing to admit the case¹⁸, or in modilying
the sentence, either at the time ¹2 or belore its formal enrolment ¹⁴. The
power ol pardon‚ vested in some lorm and to some extent in every
magistrate ¹‘, and substantially reserved by the old constitution lor the
people', has now, sofar as it exists, passed directly or indirectly to
Caesar ¹¹, asin some sense their representative.
