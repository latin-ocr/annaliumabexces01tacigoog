Οω. vlt] ROME UNDER AUGUSTUS ΛΝΒ TIBERIUS. 101

Tiberius is also specially recorded to have considered nobility ol ancestry
in his awud ol honours ¹. Consequently‚ we still find under him not
only the Aemilii Lepidi² and Calpurnii Pisones⁸ holding their heads
almost as high as under the Republic, but also many other time-honoured
names frequent in high positione, such as those ol Aurelius Cotta ⁴,
Cassius Longinusl, Cornelius Lentulus ⁸, Cornelius Sulla Felix ¹, Do·
mitius Ahenobarbus ⁸, Furius Camillus ⁹, Junius Silanus ¹⁶, Mamercus
Scaurusn, Scribonius Libo ¹², Sulpicius Galba ¹³, Valerius Messalla ¹⁴, and
others Such families showed their pride ol ancestry in the host ol
ancestors surrounding their atrium ¹⁶ and paraded at their lunerals¹';

and even their unworthy members seem to have retained no small share
ol popular reverence ¹'. Side by side with these are the houses that had
come to the iront in the revolution, as the descendants os Agrippa ¹',
Pollio ¹⁰, and Taurus ⁸⁹, or those since ennobled, as the Vitellii ἰ; while
a Sulpicius Quirinius²¹ under Augustus, or a Curtius Rulus²³ under
Tiberius, are examples ol men ol the people rising to rank by personal

energy. Such decay oi old lamilies as belongs to this stage, seems thus
to be traceable to little else but their own hideous gluttony and luxury ³⁴,
and ruinous ostentation ¹³, to their vast parlrs and villas which helped to
make the sood ol Italy dependent on wind and wave²⁸‚ and which had
seemed, even in the time ol Horace, to be crowding the fish out ol the
sea and leaving on land lew acres lor the plough ²⁷.

lt must be borne in mind that senatorial lamiiies must have ranged in
wealth srom the bare census oi a million H.S.²⁸, exceeded by many
knights and even lreedmen, to the ⁴00 millions ol an augur Lentulus “·’.
The greatest, with their vast estates and slave-gangs in Italy and the
provinces, and osten with great surns employed in trade and usury,
through indulgent administration ol prohibitory laws³⁰‚ lived on a
princely scale, and rewarded their host ol retainers with almost royal
