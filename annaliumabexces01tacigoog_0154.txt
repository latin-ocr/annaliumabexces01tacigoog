cmviii] TIBERIUS ΛΝΒ HIS GOVERNMENT. 137

petuity, was still lonnidable while he lived, and might any day return to
favour ¹.

Augustus again, while addressing Tiberius by letter in a sulsome strain
ol palpable exaggeration ², is, said to have often jested to his courtiers
about the poor Roman people, who were to be ‘so deliberately masti-
cated ς’ otten ιο have broken oli lively conversation at his approach ³, and
even in a public rescript ιο hare ‘taunted him with his personal peculi-
arities under colour ol apology ⁴.' The epigrammatists who did not spare
Tiberius even as a prince ⁵, assuredly did not spare him all this time· ; and
ewen a posthumous stroke was dealt in the will which made him principat
heir, by a pointed allusion to those who should have filled his place ².

Such circumstances, acting on such a temperament, produced much
such a character as we should expect. We are to think ol the man
Tiberius as one naturally austere, rescrved, and distant ⁸5 the best ol
whose lile had been spent in camps or in retirement; whose position at
court had been generally more or less orershadowed by rivals3 and
whose domestic lile had been wrecked lor political obJ'ects in which he
had noprimary interest; while hc had been schooled lor years in repres-
sion and disguise, with fatalists always at his elbow to tell him that his
day ol revenge would come ⁸. He had lived in the coldest shade ol'
neglect, as well as in the tull sunshine ol flattery, and could rate the
homage ol senate and people at its proper worth ¹⁰. Ol all views ol h³s
character, none is more amply borne out by laets than that which states
that his resolution was as weak as his penetration was kecn ¹¹3 so that,
tlte more clearly he could read men's minds, the more hc was at a loss
to deal with them. It is in this mixture ol strength and weakness¹¹, as
well as in the union ol his natural sets-distrust12, reserve, and austerity,
with the souring experiences ol a liletime, that we find the leading traits
ol character ot the suture ruler.
