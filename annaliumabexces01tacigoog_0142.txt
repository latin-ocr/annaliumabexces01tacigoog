of service originally lixed at sixteen ¹, and later at twenty years' service 1.
Probably the same events which led to the enrolment of additional
legions, combined with the exhaustion of the ‘aerarium militare ⁸,' led
him to postpone his obligations by a characteristic fiction ; by which the
veterans, though rernored from the legion and released frorn the oath,
were kept together under separate colours, perhaps exempted frorn camp
duties and reserwed for battle ⁴, but awaiting indefinitely their final dis·
charge and reward. The words ‘vexillum' ‘vexillarii’ and ‘vexillatis'
though ofien used of any legionary detachment under separate command ⁸,
appear to have a special application to these troops, who are distinguished
from the legions by Tacitus in several places⁸. They might be quar·
tered 1111111, or separated from their legions ⁸, and, perhaps by combina-
tion‚ are sornetirnes ιοοο strong’; but if the number 500, the only
estimste of such a battalion given in these Books, may be treated as the
normal strength of those belonging to one 11511111, it would agree with
the computation of Hyginus, who reckons thern as equivatem to an
extra cohort ¹¹.

1. ‘Cohortes civium Romanorum’ are mentioned in several inscriptions,
usually as volunteers, frequently as Italians¹¹; and may probably have
been generally formed of such as chose a military profession, and who
lived in other districts than th0se from which the home army was raised ¹⁸.
There appear to have been at one time at least thirty-two such cohorts¹‘ ;
but they are omitted in the general summary of Tacitus 11, though rnen·
tiooed with the legions in the will of Augustus ¹⁸.

Other ouxr'lrirry forces, ‘Cohorles alaeque rocrirc.'

These forces are too numerous and manifold to be here described;
their titles are giren in a multitude of 1111111911011111, and their total
strength is estimated by Tacitus as being much the same in the aggregate
