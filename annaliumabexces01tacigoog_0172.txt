whether they were iudicious, as Poppaeus Sabinus ³, leeble‚ as Apronius ⁴,
cruel· and oppressiva, as Pontius Pilate ⁸, or contumacious and dangerous,
as Gaetulicus ⁸. Even the senatorial provinces, as Asia and Africa, seem
to leel the effects ol the general irregularity²; and even the security oi

Some apparent taint ol insanity seems to come in, completing and
partly explaining the whole: perhaps traceable sometimes in the clear
evidence ol public documents; asin the attempt, in his published auto·
biography, to explain the condemnation ol Seianus by a lalsehood ol
childish transparency ⁸5 or in the famous words preserved os his letter to
the senate, publishing ιο the world his agony ol soul¹⁰. Again, at one
time reproach seems to lacerate him ¹¹, at another he parades it¹¹3
he hovers round and round Rome and never enters it ¹³; shiits his place
restlessly in the last stage ol decrepitude¹⁴. It isos little moment ιο
decide between van'ons reports ol his end, or ιο ltnow exactly how
the last lew sands ran out ol a lise that ιο any good purpose had been
extinct ior years.

the contemporary panegyric ol Tiberius by Velleius ¹⁸, a lew remarks
upon it',appear here necessary. This writer's means ol inlorrnation are
indeed unquestionable ¹⁸5 bathis burst os courtly rhetoric. over even the
slightest service ol his hero, takes away credit from his record oi more
substantial achievements, even when described by him as un eye-witness.
