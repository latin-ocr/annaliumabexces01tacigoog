whom the historian had lived should enter into the portrait ol that pre·
decessor in whose private memoirs he was said to find his chief mine oi
political wisdom ¹, and whom, notwithstanding many differences, he most
nearly resembled.

His own age, again, suggested not only a resemblance but a contrast;
between the first encouragement ol delation and its first sirm repression;
between a timid or cautious foreign policy and a career ol conquest;

possibly even between aprincc beyond all others parsimonious in building ¹,
and the grand architectural achievements oi Trajan. Other contrasts
were ready to hand within the work itsell, helping him to set oli the
qualities of Tiberius by the idealised virtues ol Germanicus ⁸, or even by
the character ol the hasty and passionate hut not ungenerous Drusus ⁴.

Still, when all this is allowed lor, much remains, and the extreme
apologists who appear to construet out ol their own inner consciousness
an ideal. Tiberius, merciiul almost to wealtness, and the lorbearing
victim oi almost incessant conspiracies, are compelled to ignore
or arbitrarily rule out ol court much substantial evidence ⁵. The stages
and periods ol change noted by Tacitus can be on the whole made out ⁸,
though we should consider the explanation put into the mouth ol Arruntius,
that the character ol Tiberius ‘had been thrown oli its balance by the
force ol despotism²,' to be nearer the tntth than the theory adopted
by the historian as his own, that ol a true character asserting itsell by
slow degrees against the disguise ol hypocrisy ⁸.

We have on the whole the character ol a prince whose friends might
well have written ‘infelix vitae diutumitate⁸' upon his epitaph. Had he
died in the lisetime ol Augustus, general opinion would have pronounced
him ‘imperii capax! At the end ol eight years' rule he would have lelt
