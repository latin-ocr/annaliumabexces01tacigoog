it is impossible that the general effect could have been other than
disastrous.

Ii our other evidence were more questionable than it is, the decline oi
literature would go iar to confirm it. Not but that even the Augustan age
is nearly stripped ol literary genius, as the great spirits bom arrd trained
under the Republic pass away, aud the few survivors at the succession
oi Tiberius attest by their position the change oi times. The great
historiari oi Rom‘e had, as it seems, abruptly closed his work, and retired
to his native Padua; the only great living poet was pining in exile on the
Euxine. But irom even the survival of such names it is indeed a desecat,

Phaedrus, aud the rhetorical writings os M. Seneca, make up all the
literature before us⁸3 and in which there is little evidence ol greater
