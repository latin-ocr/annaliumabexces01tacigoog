cmvii CONSTIYUTION of THE EARLY PRINCIPATE. 81

Claudius was the first ιο taire the name ο1 ‘ Caesar,' ιο which he had no
family claim, as a name oi the princeps and his house.

1ι has been seen that the term ‘princeps' in itseli implied no
monarchy, or even magistracy3 but in iact stood ior a combination oi
magisterial powers, so as ιο he contrasted as a kind oi greater magistracy
with the office ο1 consui, praetor, or aedile ¹. The boast oi Augustus, that
his eminenee in rank gave him no more power than his colleagues in
any office ', can only appiy, even in the letter, ιο such a case as that oi
his consulships, and has no meaning in relation to the most essential
powers oi the principate, the ‘proconsulare imperium' and ‘tribunicia
potestas,' in which he had, aa a nile, no colieague. Nor were these
powers coniined to their original iimits, hut received great successive
extensione hy steps not now always traceabie.

1. The ‘imperium' commonly called ‘proconsulare ³,'is the most
essential element ο1 his power. ‘imperium' had always necessarily
belonged to some definite magistracy, and at the first settlement in 717,
sc. ay, and ior four years afterwards, Augustus was continuously
oonsul; whence it is probabis that the power exercised by him during
this period was no other than the ancient supreme ‘imperium' oi the
oensrris over all other authorities at home and ahroad ⁴, coupied with the
assignment ο1 a ⁴ provincia’ embracing all the most imponant ponions
oi the empire. On his permanent deposition oi the consulship in 731,
ιο. 23, a more iormal definition ο1 the ‘imperium' still reserved to him
was required, and we find ironr enactments passed in this year and
shortly afterwards ⁸, that besides the command, which would have
become proconsular, oi the Caesarian provinces, certain powers, differing
irom those oi ordinary proconsuis, and distinctly consular, were expressiy
reserved ιο him, namer, an ‘imperium maius' over aii governors ο1
provinces, even those appointed hythe senate, and the retention ο1 his
‘imperium' in ltaiy and even within the pomerium ο1 Rome ⁸, besides
