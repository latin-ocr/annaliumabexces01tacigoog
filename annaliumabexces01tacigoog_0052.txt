ean. Ν] TACITUS' USE OF HIS MATERIALS. 35

Any such misleading effect of a ‘consensus auctorum' would be
aggravated, if, as has been seen to be probable in respect to the prin·
cipate of Tiberius, the original authorities belonged almost wholly to
tbe hostile section ¹. The critic might feel that he had madea con·
siderable deductiori for their prejudices, and might naturally consider
that thia was sufficient.

It ia also noteworthy that he treats the testimony of his authorities
as evidence not only for an act but for a morive¹; and only with dilli-
dence suggesta an explanation of his own⁸. Here it is probable that
the discrepency of his witnesses left him much room for choice, and
enabled him, without going beyond the alternatives suggested by them,
to interpret tbe acts in accordance with his general conception of the
character.

Furtber explanation must be found in the personal opinions of
Tacitus, and in the circumstances of his life.

His political altitude to the early Cacsars could not really be one of
indifference3 for the revolution which they accomplished and con·
solidated waa with him the main cause of the degeneracy of his own
age. Loyal aa he isto the emperors under whom he wrote; who had
‘combined monarcby with freedom‘' and brought about ‘an age ol
rare felicity, in which men might think what they wo‘uld and say what
they thought⁸;' he could aee that the remedy worlred far more slowly
than tbe disease⁸, and feel the more resentment against the supposed
authors of the latter.

His political sympathies are those of the idealist rather than the
statesman; hia golden age is before the dawn of history ⁷, and his
golden ageos Rome, the old RepublIc seen through the mist of ages,
the time when ‘equitable legislatiou vias crowrred by the Laws of the
Twelve Tablea⁸;' or, at latest, the days before the fall of the great
foreign powers had developed the dangers of security and peace ³¹.
Himself probably no more connected with the old familiea than was
Cicero, he yet cannot diveat himself of the reverenoe inspired by their
glories in the history os the early period ¹⁰. Blind to the misgovern· ,
ment which alone made revolution possible, be can see only the in·
triguea of ambitious men who brought about the fall of ‘liberty’
