and the highest, the commander ol the maniple os ¹ pilani' in the first
cohort, who would be sully styled ‘primae cohortis pilus prior,' or more
commonly ‘centurio primipilus’ or ‘primopilus¹.' In passing through
all these gradations, the centurion changed his century at each successive
step ², and in this highest position had custody ol the legionary engle,
with large accompanyingemoluments¹; ranked next to the ¹tribuni'; and
was admitted with them to the council ol the general ⁴. The centurione
appear to have still appointed their subordinate ornent but to 13333
been themselves now directly appointed by the emperor, olten as
3 personal favour ⁸, and, apparently, without previous service ¹.

Augustus had perpetuated the custorn introduced by the dictator
Caesar ’, ol placing the whole legion under the command ol 3 ‘legatus'
These ‘legati legionum ¹¹ are senators ol praetorian rank, or ina position
to espect such rank ¹¹, and, as has been seen, ranked tlso as provincial
vicegerents under the ‘legatus Augusti ¹¹.'

The position ol the legionsry ‘tribuni militum’ now becomes some·
what anomalous; inasmuch as they are no longer, as formerly, oom-
manders in turn oi the legion ¹¹, and several oi their other duties ¹⁸ must
have been transferred to the ‘praelectus castrorum ”.’ Nor do they
appear to have commanded the legionary cohorte, which, so far 33 they
had a separate command, may probably have been placed each under its
lirst centurion ¹⁸. Such ol their duties as arc still traceable can hardly be
generally characteriaed¹⁸; and this rank becomes hardly so much one
ol military promotion, as 3 ‘tirocinium' lor young men ol the highest
