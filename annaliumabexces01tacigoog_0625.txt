SUMMARY OF INTERVAL OF LOST HISTORY. 587

man back from Capreae to Rome ¹, where a more formal charge, pre-
ferred through the agency of Cassius Severus ², caused him also to be
pronounced a public enemy³ and imprisoned in a chamber in the
Palatium ⁴.

Seianus had apparently reached the height of influence. Every order
in Rome eagerly set up his statues and sent deputatious to him, and paid
to his name almost the same honour as to that of the prince; while
Tiberius constantly called him ‘Seianus meus' and spoke of him as
his ‘particeps consiliorum ⁸,' and had apparently aflianced him to his
house by a betrothal⁸; but was perhaps already secretly meditating bis
destruction.

The consulship removed Seianus to Rome, and it does not appear that
he ever again saw his master, who declined his visits on various pretexts'.
Outwardly he appears to have allowed him to receive more marks of
honour than ever, to have admitted him to a priesthood and to a0share of
the ‘proconsulare imperium ⁹,’ and even to have permitted the passing
of a futile decree, appointing him with himself to be joint consuls for five
years ¹⁰ Cirrtius Atticus, one of the ‘cohors amicorum' at Capreae ¹¹,
was struck down at the favourite's instigation ¹¹ ; while other men of rank,
among them Fufius Geminus the friend of Augusta, met a similar fate ¹³.
Though he was not himself permitted to retain the consulship, his
position seemed further secured by the substitution soon afterwards of
Fulcinius Trio, one os his creatures; and, later on, the death of Nero ¹⁴
seemed to show that the hesitation of Tiberius in dealing with this family
was at length overcome.

But the position of Gaius, who had been raised with Seianus to the

pontificate, and was generally looked on as the heir, still seemed un-
assailable¹⁸3 and several small indications of coldness or displeasure
