caused additional alann¹. Becoming desperate, Seianus lormed a con·
spiracy¹, in which many ol all ranks joined, to assassinate Tiberius on
his return ιο Rome, and ιο contrite a similar late ior Gaius¹. This
appears to have been revealed by Satrius Secundus to Antonia, and by
her, through the agency ol her lreedman, Pallas, to ‘liberius‘ ; who was
newertheless obliged to proceed with the utmost caution, as he was
unable to reclron on the fidelity ol the praetorians. A man oi determined
loyalty was secured ior the consulship in the person ol Memmius
Regulus ¹, and almost immediately afterwards the blow was struck.

The r8th oi October· is marked as the day on which the famous
meeting oi the senate took place in the Palatine Temple, at which the
‘long wordy letter from Capreae' was read. Naevius Sertorius hlacm
bad brought with him, together with this mische, his own appointment
ιο the command os the praetoriam, in which the soldiers were induced
bya liberal bribe ιο acquiesce. The ‘vigiles' over whom Seianus had
no inlluence‚ guarded the senate under their praesect Graecinus Laco,
and led Seianus ιο the dungeon where he was on the same day exe·
cuted¹. By subsequent sentences perished his eldest son ¹, his uncle
Junius Blaesus ¹, and others ¹⁰ ; while many more were thrown into
prison ιο await trial.

Tiberius, who had awaited news ol these proceedings in extreme
anxiety ¹¹, was soon afterwards filled with horror and indignation, on
a statement being made by Apicata, the divorced wile oi Seianus, re·
specting the murder oi Dmsus, with the connivance ol his adulterous
wife, eight years previously ¹². Liuilla was put to death, or more probably
compelled to commit suicide¹⁸; and lurther investigamus, conducted with
the utmost atrocities oi tenure, took place belore Tiberius himself ¹⁴.
