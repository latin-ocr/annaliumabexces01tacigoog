delect in his authors, irom the laint interest taken even in what they
might have known. lllen were ‘ignorant 01 politica, as being no business
01 theirs¹’ but that ol their rulers. Whoever has taken notice 01 the
‘indiligentia veri' possible. even now, under circumstances 01 tlte uttnost
publicity and fullest extension 01 public responsibility‚ even among poli·
ticians and political writers, on such public affairs as do not touch them
immediately, will appreciate the prosound trutlt 01 this remark 01 Tacitus,
at a time when neither such publicity nor responsibility existed.

Lastly, Tacitus divides all tlte chroniclers under the principate ¹, or at .
least all the successore 01 the great historiens 01 Augustus ⁸, into two
sharply·contrasted classes, the one, 01 those who wrote to datter the
ruling prince, the other, 01 those who poured out their pent-up rancour
alter his death.

We need not assume that eaclt prince had his chroniclers 01 botlt these
classes. ln the case 01 Tiberius especially, it has been already noticed‘,
that (except the lew pagos 01 Velleius already mentioned) no historian
is known even by name to us, as having published any account 01 the ‘res
Tiberii: ‘florente ipso ⁶! Without assuming that none existed where
none are known to us, we may reasonably suppose that lew, 11 any, cared
to publish contemporary history under a princc whose aversion to
flattery is stated to have been at least as great as his sear 01 freedom⁶3
while the subsequent rule 01 the son, brother, and grandson 01 Ger·
manicus leit abundant opportunity lor the multiplication 01 virulent
attacks on the great reputed enemy 01 that house.

We are really no less in the dark as to those who may have written on
Gaius, Claudius, or Nero, ‘florentibus ipsis’3 but it is obvious that the
satne historian may have belonged to both classes in different parts 01
his narrative ², even il he could not change sides ort the same prince with
tlte versatility 01 Seneca ⁸.
