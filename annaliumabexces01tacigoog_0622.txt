delectus a Caesare, eoque meditationes eius introspicere creditus
is fatali quodam motu (nequeenim aute specimen constantiae!
dederat) seu prava sollertia, dum imminentium oblitus incerta
pavet, inserere se dubitantibus ac monere consules ne relationem

t inciperent ; disserebatque brevibus momentis summa verti 3 posse
quandoque domus Germanici exitium paenitentiae esse seni.
simul populus effigies Agrippinae ac Neronis gerens circumsistiti
curiam faustisque in Caesarem ominibus falsas litteras et principe
invito exitium domui eius intendi clamitat. ita nihil triste illos

of the well-known Arulenus Rusticus
(16. 2⁶, 6, διο), who is called ‘lunius
Rusticus' ln Suet. Dom. to.

conponendis astrum sotis. On the
‘acta senatus· see lutrod. iii. p. 18. ll'e
haue no esrllcr record of the office here
mentioned. which is taken to be the same
ss that of ‘curator actorum wnatus'
(Inscr. llcnzeu 5447 =C. 1. l. is. ²45⁶).
or ‘ab sctis senatus’ (llenzen 5478-
Wilmanns 636, acu. lt is not certain
thst at this dste the officer was himself
s member of the senate; later, thc post
was a steppingstonc to the aedileship;
see Staatsr. ii. p. 9οι.

1. eoque. . ,creditus These minutes
were sent to Cacsar in his absence (Suet.
Tib. 73), sud their compilet must have
been so far in his confide-nce as to receive
instructions ιο suppress record of anything
obnoxious. On the construction of‘ cre·
ditus' see lntrod. v. 645.

s. {stud quodam motu, ‘impelled
somehow by his destiny'3 ie. by some
inexplicuble motiver see on 3. 30, 7.

consumatae, ‘courage‚' as t. 32, ις
¹5=5hir3ffi

3. prave, ‘misgnided'z l.e. mistalriag
his true interest. lt is explained hythe
following words: he overlooked the pre·
sent danger of thwarting Caesar, ou the
uncertain chance that he might change
his mind and punish their zeal.

4. paves. The accus. with this verb
is parient, but found in Sall. Cat. 31, 3,
Liv. und l‘l. Mat: cp. 15. ιι, a: H. 3.
56, 3. and the use of ‘ pavescere’ ἕω, 2,
διο), sud ‘expavescere' (ll. r. 7 ‚ 3).

inserere ss: soin li. r.19,3:cp.

6. germanicis titium paenitentiae senis: Germanici
esitium paenitentiae esse seni Rup, domus ins Halm.

8. festisque: text hlur.

phrase is used in 13. 2⁶, 2, where see note.

5. brevibus momentis sumans verti,
‘small things turn the scale in great
events’; ie. some intluence too slight
now to be foreseeu may change Caesar's
whole purpose. Tbe sentiment is that of
Cicero [Phil. 5. ιο, afri, ‘minimis mo·
mentis maximae inclinationes¹ tem runs
tiunt': cp. ‘momenta deficientis Agr.
43, 3, ‘momentumque fuit mutatus Curio
rerum' Luc. 4, 8194 sud note on 4 32‚4
For this sense of ⁸ brevis: Orelli compares
‘breve pondus' llor. Sat. a. ι, 37.

posse . . .sent. The corrupt MS. text
hus exercised the ingenuity of all mm·
mentators ll'alther has collected some
fourteen suggestions which had found
more or less favour down to his own
time. For others see lislm (Corum.
Crit.); Pfitrner tp. too); Ritter (Rhein
Mus. xvii. p. 130). The above reading
would express what must hare been the
sense of the original test3 aad the sb
sorption of ‘csse' between ‘ae' snd ‘s,'
ss well as the addition of ⁸ s ⁹ to ‘seni’
from ‘simul,’ cau be supposed without
difficulty; but ‘domus' though required
hy the sense. cannot have dropped ont so
easily; und possibly some words amount·
ing to s whole line in aa original M&
may have been lost.

7. euiztss . . . gerens: compare the
slmilur mode of showing attachment to
Octavia (14. 6ι, 1).

8. faustis. . . ominibus: cp. i. 35, 3·
Walther’s defence of ‘ festis' by reference
to ιο, 69, ι, dcc«, is insufficient: ιιι]
festnl expressions would have been wholly
out of plane: yet men desired to profess
due loyalty ιο Caesar, and to regard him
ss the dupe of Seianus
