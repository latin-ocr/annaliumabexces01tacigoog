rbat it never appears in the regular list oi those borne by the Caesar,
and when used at all in inscriptions, has almost always some personal
term ol honour accompanying it, as ‘princeps optimus,' ‘princeps et
conservator ¹,’ dte.

His new position is, as it were, consecrated by the title ol Augustus,
decreed by the senate ¹, and assumed on tlte roth ol January 7²7·
sc. ay ’ς a title expressive ol sanctity, and a step to the divine honours
paid to him, even during lise, in various parts oi the empirei This
title is always distinctiva ol the ‘princeps’ and, until the division ol the
empire in later times, is shared with no one.

ln the middle ol 731, s. c. a 3, Augustus closed his series ol consulships,
afterwards holding this office twice only, each time lor a lew days, on the
introduction ol his grandsons to public lile ⁸. Some ol the most essential
privileges ol that office are still reserved to him ⁸, but increased stress is
ων laid on the tribunician power, which lrom this time is assumed as ·
a title aod reclsoned annually from June 27⁷. There is no trace of
annual reelection, and the object ol the change seems to be merely to
substitute some other computation ol his years os rule lor that supplied
by bis consulships. It has been thought that a nominal change was
made from ‘ius tribunicium' to ‘tribunicia potestas ”,’ and that the power
vas further defined and amplified.

Α lotther step is marked by the offer made to him in 735, sc. 19, ol such
censoria! power as belonged to the ‘regimen legum et morum ’ἶ lt is
also stated by Dio that be received at the same time l'or lise the consular
power, with its insignia, the regular attenrlance ol twelve lictors, and
a curule chair between those ol the consuls oi the year ²⁰. This is now
generally treated as an error, except so lar as relates to the mere
assumption ol the insignia ¹¹. Augustus himself mentions two laets
only that bear upon the point. Firstly, thatin 732, tac. aa, he refused
the dictatorship, and also both the annual and perpetual consulship ¹¹.
