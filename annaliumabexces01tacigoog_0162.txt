catut] TIBERIUS AND HIS GOVERNMENT. 145

reu. 23-28, the niuth to the fifteenth of the rule of Tiberius, and the
sixiy-sountr to the seventieth of his life. The words seem a platitude,
and the ‘bona' if not admitted to have been real before, must be sup·
posed less real now. Tacitus must be understood to mean that some evil
traits, such as cruelty and covetousness ¹, begin to escape their disguisc,
but that the appearance of many virtues is kept up.

lt is at this stage that the figure of Seianus is brought more distinctly
to the front as the leading influence of the period ², though still held in
checlr by Augusta. His portrait, if we had it complete, would no doubt
have been found to be drawn with only less elaboration than that given
to Tiberius himself, and the steps of his rise are still left clearly indicated
to us. He is the personal adherent of Tiberius alone, dissociated afile
frorn the rest of the imperial family and from the senate. We have him
described, succeeding to the ‘praefectura praetorii' asan unimportant
office, and making it the most important position in the state ⁸, already,
though onlya knight, admitted to some share in the ‘imperium' of the
prince ⁴, enabled by slrilful pretextato bring about a change more fraught
with results in later Roman history than any other event of this principate,
by conceutrating the guard in a barraclr close outside the walls, and
bringing thern far closer than before to his personal influence ⁸, promptly
retrieving the one false move of too bold a request for the hand of Livia ⁸,
and soon more than restoring his position bya lucky act of sslf-devoti0n²:
step ογ step his great aims are steadily advanced, Drusus is got rid of, the
family of Germanicus undermined ογ a series of attaelrs⁸, and by the
overthrow of one friend after another’: through him alone can the great
prizes of state be reached ¹⁰, nobles stooped to compliance to win so much
asan interview, anrl paid court even to his menials ¹¹, to be accused by
one of his creatores was to make condemnation inevitable ¹².

This whole period is described in an eloquent passage as a dreary
chronicle of ‘cruel orders, incessant accusations, treacherous friendships¹³l
Under an exaggeration, similar to that of earlier passages ¹⁴, we discern
this truth, that the record of trials, mostly for state offences, is almost the
τ sole domestic history of the time; and that, besides a large increase in
the number of such cases, from about twelve in eight years to about
