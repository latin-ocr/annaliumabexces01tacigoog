Camlll] TAclws’ sotJRces OF INFORMATION. 21

He, with all the materials before him which we have, aad much rnore
which we have not, finds himself, at the establishment of tlte principate,
passing from daylight into comparative darkness, deepening, no doubt,
towards his own time, as publicity was more and more suppressed.

In former days, public affairs were discussed before senate and people,
by persons of every shade of opinion; now the forum was silenced‚ even
the minutes of the senate were no longer published, and the vast depart-
ments centred in the princeps received their intelligence and transacted
their business in private, and communicated no more than they thought
fit. What was divulged could not be tested, and those who disbelieved the
information had only surmise to substitute for it. Sometimes, no doubt,
light was afterwards thrown on a dark place, through the record of their
own transactions by public men ¹, or authentic private communications
which found their way into history, and exposed the falsifications of an
imperial bureau. Tacitus, for instance, or his informante, seem ,to have
had means of hnowing that the official report of Tiberius on the Gallie
revolt was no more nor less than truth²; and that, on the other hand, he
had concealed the extent of the losses inflicted by the Frisii ⁸. lt must be
plain, to take no further instances, that our full narrative of the Pan·
nonius and German mutiny, and of the German wars, can be no mere
transcript of the report laid before the senate ⁴. ι

But as regards all matters not forcing themselves by their magnitude
on public notice, much of the most interesting history must have been
buried for ever in the archives of the prinee. To illustrate this, we may
compare the information, scanty as it is, which we have in the Annals, of
the grievances, deputations, inner life of a senatorial province such as
Asia, with the absence of even any similar accounts of any Caesarian
province during this period. We should have known little enough, frorn
official, or indeed from any purely Roman sources of the grieva'nees
brought by Philo before Gaius, or of the oppressions which goaded
Judaea to desperation ³.

Many again of the state trials which form so large a part of domestic
history were either before the emperor's private court ⁶, or cases in which
the senate merely registers a sentence, passed on receipt of a letter or
notes of evidence from the prinee or even his minister ⁷.
