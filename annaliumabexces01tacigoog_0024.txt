cm.r.] LIFE 24er WORKS OF TACITUS. 7

eristing, purporting to be only the latter half of its original bulk ¹,
appears to have been brought to Rome to Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici
(afterwards Leo X), who a lew years later entrusted its publication to
Beroaldus, in whose edition, published at Rome in 1515, these Books
appear for the first time among the works ol Tacitus ¹.

There are some discrepancies as to the circumstances oi its acquisition,
and neither Fulda nor Hersseld, but. the monastery of Cdrvey, in West·
phalia, is mentioned as the place ol its discovery ⁸. Bandini had assigned
it to the eleventh century, but recent scholars think it as early as the tenth
or even the ninth ⁴, though there seems to be no evidence lor Ritter's

view that it is the same MS. known to have existed at Fulda. An ’

excellent [acsimile ol the first page of Book 111 is given by Vitelli and

Paoli⁵, and a photographic reproduction ol the first page of Book I in
hl. Hochart's work ⁸.

The text, at various stages oi its derivation, has sometimes suffered
from a misleading hall knowledge, and more seriously, at a later date,
from complete ignorance ol Latinity, added to carelessness of eye or
ear, in its copyists, whereby words have been mutilated and wrongly
divided, letters mistaken or transposed, syllables dropped or assimilated
to those next to them, glosscs have crept into the text, or ‘lacunae'
have passed unnoticed ¹.

These errors had not wholly escaped the old revisers, whose erasures,
linear and interlinear corrections, and dots placed above or below letters
to be expunged, are now careiully noted ⁸.
