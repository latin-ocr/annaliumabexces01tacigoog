T nn Lexicon Taciteum of Bdtticher ¹, the Excursus of Roth on the
Agricola ', and the ‘Index Latinitati's’ in Ruperti’s edition ⁸, represented
l'or some time the chief results of the labour of scholars on this subject;
but the literary activity of recent years in Germany has superseded those
by a large number of treatises, mostly on special points, many of which
are guthered up into and supplemeuted by the valuable treatise of
Dr. Draeger⁴, still the most complete and systematic work on the

subject, from which far the greater part ol the substance of what ia here
given has been derived, and to which all who desire further information
are throughout referred ⁸. In the necessarily limited selection here made,
it is intended to illustrate not only such points of usage and style as are
