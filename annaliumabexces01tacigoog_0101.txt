force. But from the tribunician power of the Caesar all these weaknesses
were removed. The tribunes of the year were in no sense his colleagues,
and their voice was pou-erless against his¹ ; the office was held for life;
and the power of the sword was known to be in reserve. This office
fully retained memory of its popular origin; for the decree of the senate
conferring it was only preiiminary to a ratificatory ‘lex' or ‘plebiscite,'
which survived even the general abolition of the comitia ¹! Α fragment
still remains of the socelled ‘lex de imperio Vespasiani ⁸,’ which, while
apparently conveying in form the tribunician power, specifice far more
prerogatives than such as belong to the conception of that office, and
must either be taken to show an almost indefinite extension of its idea,
or to include other distinct powers vested in the princeps, perhaps all
such aa were considered to require a ‘lex' to detine and ratify them ⁴.
”l'hat this power would of itself give full right to convohe and consult
the senate, is matter of course ⁸, and the special privileges mentioned
above· as belonging to the princeps in doing so, if they are not rightly
viewed as part ol his ‘imperium' must be taken to belong to his
tribunician power. lt is at any rate in virttte of that power that he had
absolute control of its proceedings when convoked, and we hnd it his
habit either to gulde their decision by speaking first or to reserve him·
self to the end ⁷, so as either by formal νοω· or less formal modification'
to amend the proposais of others. No less complete and no less
indefinite in its extension must have been his tribunicinn power of
controlling the action ol other magistrates, and it appears that the ‘ius
auxilii, ad tuendam plebem, and general coercive power even originally
extended a mile beyond the pomerium ¹⁰, and must ultimately have been
unrestricted by any limit ol distance ¹¹. If we look at this unlimited consti·

with which it might be made to apply on almost any and ali occasions,
