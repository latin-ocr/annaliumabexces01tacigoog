cmvii] ROME UNDER AUGUSTUS ΑΝΙ) TIBERIUS. 111

with the Alpine pasees opening out regular communication with Gaui
and the Danubian provinces, secured by important towns, among which
Augusta Praetoria (hosta), at tbe meeting point of two great roads,
may be specially mentioned¹. ln the newly won territory, Augusta
vindelicorum (Augsburg) is an important centre of traffic with friendly
Germana in the time of Tacitus ¹. Gaul owes to Augustus its organi·
xation ⁸, the systematic census on which its tribute was permanently
based‘; the constitution of the diet of the sixty-four cantons⁸‚ and the
supreme position of Lugdunum, and the worship of the emperor there
established⁸. ,

ln the eastern portion of the empire we have no important conquesta.
Thrace was still left in what proved to be an unsatisfactory position of
vassalage', but the empire in Asia Minor hy the annexation of the
dominions of the Galatian liugand of Paphlagonia became acompact
territory extending to the Halys and lllount Taurus ⁸, while the great
province of Syria, except where it touched the Euphrates, was flanlced and
protected by vassal kingdoms’. To make the statement in the ‘Monu-
mentum hncyranum¹⁰' correct, we should suppose also that the frontiers
of Egypt had been advanced at the expense of the Aethiopian aggressors,
and those of Cyrenaica and Africa at that of the Marmaridae and
Garamantes.

ln the statement that at the death of Augustus the empire was
bounded by the ocean or by distant rivers ¹¹, these provinces are left out
of sight3 but we know that in the time of Tiberius Egypt ended at
Elephantine and Syene ¹¹, and that the other African provinces must have
been always limited to the strip possessed by Hellenic, Phoenician and

phales' to restore other roads from their
