Omuo to constant intermarriages between members ol the imperial
family, the relationships between many ol the persons whose names
occur in these rables are extremely intricate, even without considering
the further complication introduced by adoptione. Thus the children
oi Germanicus are on their mother's side direct descendants os Au·
gustus, and on their father's side direct descendants ol Octavia, as weil
as descendants os the Claudian house. The emperor Nero, besides
partaking os all these relationships through his mother, was also directly
descended lrom Octavia on his father’s side. All the descendants os
Dmsus‚ brother os Tiberius, trace a similar desoent through Antonia;
the children ol Drusus, son oi Tiberius, become members ol that

members oi the Claudian stoclr who stand in no blood-relationship
to Augustus3 and Stem B might have been almost wholly included
under A.

It is hoped that tlre arrangement here adopted will indicate intel-
ligibly all the relationships oi consanguinity. of the adoptione, the
most important to bear in mind are those oi Octavius by the will ol
Julius Caesar, os Tiberius by Augustus, oi Germanicus by Tiberius, and
ol Nero by Claudius.
