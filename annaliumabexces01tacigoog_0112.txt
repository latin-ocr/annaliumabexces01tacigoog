emath] CONSTITUTION OF THE EisLY PRINCIPATE. 95

to name no more nor lever candidates than thore were vacancies¹ ; and
thus to reduce the whole election to a sham; sor, though the presiding
consul had probably power to publish a supplementary list ¹, those
‘nominated’ by Caesar would be sure ol preference. ln the choice oi
consuls this mode ol intluence seems to have been adopted. There is
no trace ol formal ⁴ commendatio: or ol special ‘candidati Caesaris’ sor
this office, but care seems to have been taken always to control the
elections by nominating only two candidates ³.

Again, candidates ior the quaestorship, which gave admission to the
senate, must have been ‘tribuni militum,' or have served on the ‘viginti-
viratus ‘,' and had usually filled botb positions. Ol these qualifications,
the first, as a military rank, could clearly be only obtained with consent
ol Caesar ⁸.

Besides those entering the senate through magistracy, others are men·
uoned in inscriptions, as early as the time ol the censorship os Claudius
and tbat ol Vespasian, as ‘adlecti a principe⁶,’ and names were no
doubt added at the ‘lectiones senatus' held by Augustus'. Such
‘adlecti' have usuallya rank assigned as it they had been qualibed by
office ⁸. The exclusion os senators on the annual revision ol the list
bas been already mentioned, as well as the constant control ol that body
by the rights of ‘relation' and ‘intercession · ;’ ιο which may be added
tbe power ol preventing obnoxious senators lrorn drawing lots ior
provinces ¹⁸.

The duality ol governrnent is thus shown to be fictitious ; but it was
the policy ol most principes, especially ol Augustus and Tiberius, to lay
‘public affairs and the most important matters relating to individuals'
before the senate, ‘to allow the chief men to debate, and even to checlt
their servitiryss! Besides the format share ol government already men-
