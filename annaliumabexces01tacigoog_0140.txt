By the year 882, tun. ⁶9, we lind the number ol legions increased
to thirty-one, in consequence oi the occupatiori os Britain and other
subsequent etents; but it is subsequently reduced to thirty. The local
disposition is also altered by that time in many cases ¹.

The legion consisted, as at other times, oi ten cohorte, divided into
thirty maniples and sixty centuries¹; hut we have no certain information
oi its numerical strength. The estimate ol 6100 loot and 726 horse
given by Vegetius’, would certainly not agree with that oi this time in
respect os the ‘equites legionis,' who appear now to have only num·
bered 120⁴, nor is there any evidence that the first cohort was now, as in
tbe tirne oi vegetius, twice the strength ol the others ³. Ila medium
estimate ot about eighty rnen to the century be talten ⁸, the total strength
of the legion, including its ollicers, its cavalry, and those in charge ol the
‘hadistae' and other engines forming its train oi artillery', would amount
to rather more than 5000.

The old names ‘hastati' ‘principes’ and ‘pilani‚' survive⁸3 and,
though no longer designating any difference ol equipment, denote pre·
cedence in honorary rank. Each cohort contained two centuries‚ or one
maniple, ol each oi these; and the cohorts also rank in honour accord·
ing to their number. This hierarchy ol rank serves to place the sixty
centurione in a constantly ascending series; the maniple, rather than
the century, being the unit ol the legion, and being under the command
ol the first oi its two centurions. The lowest centurion would thus be
the subordinate centurion ol the 'hastati’ os the tenth cohort, styled
‘decumus hastatus posterioris centuriae: or ‘decumus hastatus posteri0r3'
