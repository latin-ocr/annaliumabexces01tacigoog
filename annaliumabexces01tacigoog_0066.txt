31. Sorne characteristic uses ol the ablatire ot attendant obcum-
stanoas, or ablativa absolute, are to be noted.

(a) qne nse effre participle in this case as predicate, write a sentence as
subject (Roby 1²5²l· This usage, very rare belore Livy, occurs never
in the minor writings oi Tacitus, only six times in the Historias, but,
repeatedly in the Annals. Among the participles which Tacitus appears
to be the first so to use are adiecto 4. 70, 7; credito (dir. rip.) 3. ι4, 4;
distincto (der. rip.) rr. 38, 2 ; intellecto ι. 49, 3 ; pensitato 3. 52, 4 ; ι2. ιγ,
3 (only); praedicto (eir. rip.) ι6. 33, 3 ; quaesito 2. 9, ι; 6. ι5, ι (only);
repetito 3. 33, ι (ὄπ. εἶρ.); scripto (ὄπ. rip.) ι 3. 56, 4, tre. Dr. l at 3.

(b) Tire neuter aetjeetiees sehrelarly used, as periculoso ι. 6, 6; libero 3.
6ο, 6, are probably to be taken, with Botticher, as following the Greek
usage with the (not always expressed) participle oi cipi: thus iuxta peri-

culoso = όμυὶωι ἐπικινδύνου (ὅποι). Substantives are also so usedosee
on rr. ra, 3.

(c) An atty'ectize or participle osten stands conciseiy in titis case by itseffi
tehen tlte subject has been recentty· expressed, as cohibita 3. 33, ι; conce·
dente 6. ι6, 5; invalido 6. 47, 4; οι ewen when asubject, whether
definite οι indefinite, can be supplied lrom the sense, as orantibus r. 29,
a; subitis H. r. 7, 4; requirentibus H. ι. 23, 3, &o (see §.54); such
instances are tound also in Caes. and Livy, but are not always clearly
distinguishablc irorn datives. Dr. § 2ι2 a, b, Nipp. on ι. 29 ; 5. ιο.

(d) sse transitive ure, in this case, of deponent participles, as secutus
6. ι7, 4; ιι. 25, ι; ausus ta. 32, ²3 adgressus ι3, 43, 8; transgressus
