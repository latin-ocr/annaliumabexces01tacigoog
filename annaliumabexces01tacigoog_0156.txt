limits oi empire¹,’ lor the ‘timid or envious' advice oi Augustus ¹, and
lor a prince who ‘cared not to extend the irontier,' and under whom
‘peace was slightly ii at all disturbed¹.' Yet this policy, while prudent
and consistent, was not undignihed. The civil war oi Arminius and
hiaroboduus¹ fully attests the wisdom oi leaving Germany to its internal
conflicts ¹. The anxiety to preserve order¹, and to settle difficulties
without recourse to anm', will commend itsell no less than the just
partition ol Thrace under its own princes ¹; the acquisition of Cappadocia
with advantage both to its own inhabitants and ιο the Roman people¹ ;
and the maintenanoe oi prestige in the East without open breach with
Parthia; while Armenia is secured to the Roman interest through a prince
of Roman sympathies, yet not too Roman sor his subjecte ¹¹.

Agaim the severe punishment ol governors lor extortion will he
generally held deserving oi more praise than is awarded by the historian,
who, even when candidly admitting a case oi proved guilt in this respect,
appears to lay no stress upon it ¹¹. lior can we share his apparent regret
that largess was not lavished on the needy descendant ol the Hortensii ¹²;
the more so as it is admitted that Tiberius cared not, at least at this time,
to enrich himsell¹¹, or to be sparing ol bounty to persons ¹¹ or communi·
ties ¹¹ on just occasion.

Again, when all his resources were strained to seed the people ¹¹, we
should hardly blame the economy, even il we are allowed to imagine no
better motive, stom which their mere amusements were curtailed ¹¹.

To say that he was austere and generally leared ¹¹, is to say that his
disposition was such as nature and circumstances had made it; nor is
his carelessness oi popularity unaccompanied with the rational desire oi
solid approval ¹¹.

The evidence on which the whole ol this period is pronounced to be
one ol mere sustained hypocrisy, is best challenged by taking the leading
instances alleged.

The first instance is at the outset, when a show is made ns declining
the principate which every step had been taken to secure. Undoubtedly
> the reluctance was so lar insincere, that his· Rhodian retirement must
have taught him, that ior one so placed, the only sasety was to rule ; but
