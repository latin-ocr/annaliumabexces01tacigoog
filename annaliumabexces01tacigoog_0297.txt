‘relabentem' is soristic (see lntrod. v.

that such a mass 'ensned‚' ne. esnethe

oi tbese prophecies, formed aiter the de·
struation ol the old books with the Capi·

explanation. that he considered this a

4. Ateio Ospitoni. This great y'nrist

Macedoniarn. bis country was re·
duced to s province in 608, nc. 146,

levari. ..prononsulsri imperio. lt
is implied that the Caesarisn government
was less costly. One explanation is sug·
gested by c. 80, s, that the expense oi
separate stalis was saved by giving one
‘legatus’ charge oi two or more pro·
vinces. Macedonia and Achaia were
restored to the senate by Claudius in,
797, au. 44 (Diade. 24, ¹3 Suet.Cl.a5).
