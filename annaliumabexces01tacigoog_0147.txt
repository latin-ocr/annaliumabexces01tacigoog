have been steadily extending itself. By the manumission of slaves,
which, in spite of cbecks imposed upon it, must have been constant, any
Roman could call into existence those who at a stroke of the wand
succeeded to most ¹, and whose sons would succeed to all, civic privileges.
Many a Roman pauper by transplantation to a colony became there the
parent of a prosperous civic family. Many an auxiliary soldier, already
habituated to Roman customs by service under the standards, received
the civitas on his discharge ², and his sons might serve and rise in the
ranks of the legions and thus lay the foundation of a career of honour.
Lastly, in spite of the vast diversity of tolerated religione, some traces
of common religione ideas begin to develop themselves. The restora-
tion of religion had formed a great part of the poliey of Augustus, and
his aspirations are devoutly seconded by the poets of his court ¹. Besides
the rebuilding or restoration of almost every temple in the city ⁴, he had
endeavoured to bring horne religion to the mass of the people by a kind
of parochial system, in the worship of the ‘Lares compitales' at the 30⁰
chapels' instituted in the various vici, under the ministration of their
freedmen priests l‘Augustales'), and superintendence of the ‘vicoma-
gistri ⁸.' With these the worship of his own ‘Genius’ was associated⁷, by
which constant usage, as well as by the ‘ludi compitalicii ⁸,’ the political
order was connected with the sacred ideas of domestic security; not
only in Rome and Italy, but in many parts of the empire ⁹. To this was

added afterwards throughout the empire the later cult of the ‘Divus
Augustus ¹⁰¹ and his deified successors; as alsoin some cases, that of the

living Caesar, associated with the imperial city ¹¹: the whole forming a kind
ol apotheosis of order and peace, which appears to have been for the
present the nearest approach to an universal religion.

Otherwise there was more interchsnge than fusion of manifold reli·
gions. Temples to Jupiter Capitolinus are found in provinces ¹¹ ; and, in
turn, whatever was attractive in provincial religions struck root in Rome;
and supplied, what the colder forms of the state ritual failed to supply,
soine food for the fervour of religione enthusiasm and for speculative
theology. Many foreign religions obtained special licence, and even the
